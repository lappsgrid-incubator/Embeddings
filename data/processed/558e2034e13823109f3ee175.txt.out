this viewpoint exemplify gregory moore write after moenkopi time widespread erosion partly bevel soft moenkopi strata place carve distinct erosion channel 
the subsequently deposit shinarump conglomerate constitutes widespread thin veneer cover erosion surface fill depression 
adherent viewpoint regard unconforn1ity channel form probably middle triassic shinarump member deposit much later second independent episode likely late triassic time

the second hypothesis suggest channel cut streams deposit shinarump member therefore contemporaneous age basal sedimentary rock shinarump 
there appear general agreement shinarump member deposit widespread surface low relief agreement exist surface form 
stokes considers form synchronously deposition shinarump represent pediment deposit 
mckee 1951a however considers surface flood plain upon shinarump late deposit

when one considers coarse grain resistant material compose shinarump member seem unlikely formation could deposit without scour siltstone shale underlie moenkopi formation 
suggest therefore scour channel occur deposition shinarump member large extent least period erosion prior deposition 
why one channel continuous another unknown
