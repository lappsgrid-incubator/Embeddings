the data present add grow body literature suggest pleosporales relate fungi important biocrust constituent present biocrusts many type drylands 
this conservation specific fungal lineage biocrusts suggest fungi provide important ecosystem service biocrusts yet determine 
while dark septate fungi within pleosporales hypothesize form nutrient bridge biocrusts nearby grass green other strong evidence interaction still need 
although attempt avoid visible lichen sample strategy detect numerous lichen fungal taxon sequence survey 
the morphology pigmentation lichens may make difficult discern filamentous cyanobacterial biocrusts 
for example black pigment specie within verrucariales may resemble scytonemicpigmented cyanobacterial mat 
these result suggest cyanobacteria dominate biocrusts mixed community cyanobacteria lichen

the nectivore guild bluegray gnatcatcher black chin hummingbird high occupancy downstream whereas bewick wren low occupancy downstream 
spence also find specie presence vary along colorado river corridor 
find similar result bewick wren common upper middle reach river whereas black chin hummingbird blue gray gnatcatcher find reach suitable habitat generally occur downstream 
the importance geomorphic reach observe probably due large change habitat elevation vegetation composition one move colorado river 
total vegetation volume average across year variable strongly influenced occupancy two 
occupancy estimate blue gray gnatcatcher yellow breast chat increase total vegetation volume 
similarly sogge other spence find bird abundance specie richness diversity positively associate volume large woody plant specie 
specie guild reflect increase decrease trend year analysis period 
relatively small number detection year repeat survey high variability detection presence among year preclude find statistically reliable trend 
some variability occupancy estimate across year relatively large associate standard error explain high interannual variability number detection well sample methodology issue 
for seed forage guild majority detection occur few 
addition majority sit receive two annual point count many specie detect one point count station create low estimate detect therefore great occupancy within site sample twice per year kendall white 
additional replication visit every site long time period would help decrease bias variability guillera arroita other 
spence power analysis also determine year survey necessary determine reliable trend individual avifaunal specie grand canyon number survey vary specie 
proceeding 12th biennial conference research colorado plateau 
although many result similar study model occupancy among specie guild typically exhibit low model weight indicate variable use highly informative 
these result also could partially attribute small number detection obtain specie 
there several factor involve collection avifaunal data likely contribute relatively small total number detection lack precision estimate 
the acoustic characteristic grand canyon couple noise colorado river although included detect covariate could lead misidentification bird call few detection overall especially inexperienced observer 
site sample per year majority sit sample time entire study period due range logistical resource environmental constraint 
addition repeat survey detection history use model derive single visit site truly independent space time 
this unavoidable situation increase likelihood estimator inference factor influence either occupancy detection bias 
lack independence detect among site typically result occupancy overstate mackenzie other consider interpreting result 
however repeat survey benefit minimizing time closure assume occupancy model rota other 
increase well distributed sample site precisely determine measured variable survey throughout course season would allow gcnp gain well understanding interaction improve model performance specie guild level 
community estimate study avian specie richness appear influenced vegetation volume visitor use level 
specifically observed specie richness positively associate total vegetation volume great area visitor use 
specie sensitive disturbance human may avoid area human activity common may occur reduce abundance decrease likelihood specie observe point count survey 
decrease richness high visitor use area may due low vegetation volume campsite change vegetation structure type wolf other 
other researcher also find negative relation recreation intensity abundance vegetation bird specie richness miller other steven other wolf other 
schlesinger other find disturbance human activity might important factor richness surpass even habitat loss development 
additional information vegetation type site level information may lead good understanding difference use level 
for example particular vegetation type structure may present high low use site control site 
consistent hypothesis relative abundance avifaunal guild associate visitor activity always way predict 
the omnivore ground forager higher abundance campsite however see increase insect ground forager expect 
schlesinger other also find omnivore abundance positively related recreational activity urban stressor 
omnivore great dietary flexibility enable success environment alter food resource chace walsh 
although see difference insect foliage gleaner ground forager see great abundance insect aerial forager campsite compare control site 
aerial insect forager may abundant campsite open would allow good visibility fly insect easier aerial maneuver forage eckhardt 
the nectivore guild guild significantly low abundance campsite compare control site 
the nectivore guild may higher abundance control sit black chinned hummingbird dominant specie nectivore guild study area nest almost exclusively tamarisk nhwz vegetation brown typically abundant control site 
schlesinger other also find change abundance certain dietary guild specifically dramatic decrease richness dietary specialist principally insectivores granivores nectivores increase development recreation 
the difference detect richness diversity ohwz nhwz interpret cautiously 
although use welch test account uneven sample size difference number sit great unbalanced sample size could influence result undesirable way 
addition hellmann fowler find jack1 estimator richness negatively bias small sample size positively bias large sample size thereby create great difference richness among site really exist 
however spence also find majority specie detect nhwz 
speculate difference number detection two water zone could relate change vegetation community 
the ohwz vegetation community consist variety xeric specie whereas nhwz consist mostly riparian specie 
thus fundamental zone difference vegetation distance water probably influence specie diversity abundance 
although unable discern difference lower amount vegetation volume visitor use avifaunal community factor probably play role community structure 
decrease avifaunal richness highuse area could attribute less amount vegetation volume visitor use impact 
likely human activity directly affect behavior individual bird specie boyle sampson blumstein other flush nest forage site reduce time energy available important activity fernández juricic 
these change behavior lead extirpation 
visitor use impact habitat association avifauna occupy colorado river corridor 
sensitive vulnerable specie reduction richness abundance nectivores observe 
for future effort sample avifauna colorado river corridor would suggest gcnp alter sample design consider approach avifaunal sample demographic parameter estimation base occupancy framework rather distance framework 
occupancy base approach example mackenzie other rely few assumption estimate density abundance derive distance framework often robust low detection permit estimation proportion area occupy specie informative statistic manager density abundance allow estimation multiseason dynamic occupancy parameter include colonization extinction rate provide flexible mean compare community composition diversity among group specie guild specific occurrence richness evenness 
sample site twice year collect data year park would able implement multiseason occupancy approach allow account imperfect detection determine trend occupancy 
for purpose estimate demographic parameter occupancy density condition habitat covariates recommend add additional habitat environmental variable measure survey location directly use remotely sense data indirectly 
these variable could include dominant vegetation type patch size slope elevation among other hypothesize predict occupancy one target specie 
indeed sogge other find patch area volume woody plant specie grand canyon best predictor bird specie abundance richness area alone account percent variation data

this setup allow recorder detector run stable power source facilitate data download periodic change digital storage medium flash memory use recorder 
the bat detection system turn sunset run continuously night provide approximately hour monitor 
analysis data achieve use sonobat version software 
before analysis file parse scrubbed use sonobat 
this relatively quick process separate short snippet audio call contain obvious bat call 
this process significantly reduce processing time 
after scrub remain recording subject automated analysis use specie classification feature software

these report include consensus count correct count estimate likelihood presence elp individual specie 
the consensus count specie specific tally consensus decision generate software 
the correct count considers specie respective call ambiguity reduces consensus count minimize misclassifications provide confident conservative count 
the elp probabilistic estimate base know ambiguity overlap particular specie sonobat version
