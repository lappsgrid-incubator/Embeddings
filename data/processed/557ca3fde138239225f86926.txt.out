foreword the geological survey usgs commit serve nation accurate timely scientific information help enhance protect overall quality life facilitates effective management water biological energy mineral resource 
information quality nation water resource critical interest usgs integrally link longterm availability water clean safe drinking recreation suitable industry irrigation habitat fish wildlife 
escalate population growth increase demand multiple water us make water availability measure term quantity quality even critical long term sustainability community ecosystems 
the usgs implement national waterquality assessment nawqa program support national regional local information need decision related water quality management policy 
shape coordinate ongoing effort federal state local agency nawqa program design answer what condition nation stream grind water 
how condition change time 
how natural feature human activity affect quality stream ground water effect pronounce 
combine information water chemistry physical characteristic stream habitat aquatic life nawqa program aim provide science base insight current emerging water issue 
nawqa result contribute informed decision result practical effective water resource management strategy protect restore water quality 
since nawqa program implement interdisciplinary assessment nation important river basins aquifer refer study unit 
collectively study unit account percent overall water use population serve public water supply representative nation major hydrologic landscape priority ecological resource agricultural urban natural source contamination 
each assessment guide nationally consistent study design method sample analysis 
the assessment thereby build local knowl 
edge water quality issue trend particular stream aquifer provide understanding water quality varies regionally nationally 
the consistent multi scale approach help determine certain type waterquality issue isolate pervasive allows direct comparison human activity natural process affect water quality ecological health nation diverse geographic environmental setting 
comprehensive assessment pesticide nutrient volatile organic compound trace metal aquatic ecology develop national scale comparative analysis study unit finding 
the usgs place high value communication dissemination credible timely relevant science recent available knowledge water resource apply management policy decision 
hope nawqa publication provide need insight information meet need thereby foster increased awareness involvement protection restoration nation water 
the nawqa program recognize national assessment single program cannot address water resource issue interest 
external coordination level critical fully integrate understanding watershed cost effective management regulation conservation nation water resource 
the program therefore depend extensively advice cooperation information federal state interstate tribal local agency non government organization industry academia stakeholder group
