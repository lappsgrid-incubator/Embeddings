total recoverable reserve pakistan estimate approximately million ton table 
the estimate conservative cannot significantly improve without additional definitive information 
the annual coal production pakistan estimate million ton

the reason increase rest increase demand coal brick making industry use estimate percent annual coal production present 
this demand expect increase annual rate percent economic development country continue 
only total electrical generate capacity country create use coal 
the total electricity generate capacity pakistan prediction need near future 
coal alone supply even one quarter energy increase capacity annual coal production pakistan would increase factor 2or million nsj annually 
the coal pakistan largely tignite subbituminous rank accord astm standard though small quantity reach rank high volatile bituminous
