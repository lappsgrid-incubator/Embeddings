WATER RESOURCES OF THE UPPER COLORADO RIVER BASIN-BASIC DATA
By W. V. IOBNS, C. H. HEMBREE, D. A. PHOENIX, and G. L. OAKLAND

ABSTRACT
This is the basic data section of a report by the U.S. Geological Survey on the water resources of the Upper Colorado River Basin. This section contains tables of duration of water discharge at 176 stream-gaging sites, monthly and annual summaries of chemical quality and sediment data at sites of continuous record, results of chemical quality and sediment analyses at miscellaneous-sampling sites, data on the chemical quality and other characteristics of ground water, and isohyetal maps of normal seasonal and annual precipitation. Also included is an inventory of surface-water records of streamflow, chemical quality, and suspended sediment. Location of gaging stations, chemical-quality and sediment-sampling sites, and wells and springs, are shown on a map of the Upper Colorado River Basin.
INTRODUCTION
Maximum utilization and efficient management of the water resources of the Colorado River Basin will be required to meet growing demands for domestic, industrial, irrigation, and recreational uses of water. Use of surface water already exceeds half the supply, and projects for additional development must comply with the limits imposed by legal, physical, and economic barriers. These facts have focused attention on the need for appraisal of the remaining supply and identification of the effects of additional developments on the streams of the river system.
To fulfill a part of this need, an appraisal report on the water resources of the Upper Colorado River Basin has been prepared with emphasis on water quality. This, the basic-data section of the report, contains hydrologic and related data that were assembled for the appraisal study. Some of these data were already available but were scattered among many published volumes and files of agencies and individuals. Additional data were collected or developed for the study. This compilation of data will be useful to those who have the responsibility for developing the water resources and to others interested in the water resources of the basin.
This section contains a wide range of hydrologic and related data for the Upper Colorado River Basin. Included are flow-duration tables for about onefourth of the streamflow gaging stations; all available sediment and surface-water chemical-quality data either in summarized form or analyses of

individual samples; chemical analyses and related geologic data for about 1,000 samples of ground water; isohyetal maps of seasonal and annual precipitation; and an inventory of all surface-water records in the basin.
SOURCES OF DATA
Sources of data are acknowledged in the following paragraphs. In the tables, data not identified by a footnote were obtained from publications or files of the U.S. Geological Survey.
Streamflow data in Water-Supply Papers and unpublished data in the files of district offices of the Geological Survey were used to prepare flow-duration tables of water discharge. The Water-Supply Papers that contain streamflow data are listed on pages 6 7.
Chemical quality of water data in publications of the Geological Survey that are listed on page 7 were used in preparing the monthly and annual summaries for most of the daily chemical-quality stations. Some analyses of samples from miscellaneous sites were also obtained from these publications. "Miscellaneous sites" are sites where samples were collected at infrequent intervals. Many previously unpublished analyses of samples from miscellaneous sites were obtained from files of the Geological Survey. In addition, a reconnaissance program of water-sample collection was conducted by the Geological Survey in 1957 and 1958. Water-quality data were also obtained from reports of Thorne and Thorne (1951, p. 52 61), Connor, Mitchell, and others (1958), and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (1959). The Bureau of Reclamation furnished many unpublished chemical analyses for miscellaneous sites throughout the upper basin (P. B. DeLong and J. M. Barrett, written communication). The Salinity Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Riverside, Calif,, furnished daily chemical-quality records for three stations in the Duchesne River basin as well as chemical analyses of samples collected at miscellaneous sites (L. V. Wilcox, written communication). The Agriculture Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, furnished chemical-quality data on storm runoff in

WATER RESOURCES OF THE UPPER COLORADO RIVER BASIN BASIC DATA

the southern San Juan River basin (J. E. Fletcher, written communication).
Tables of chemical analyses of ground water contain analyses that have previously been published and some that were collected by the Geological Survey but which had not been published. Sources of analytical data, other than the Geological Survey, are indicated by footnotes to the tables and are listed on page 5. Previously unpublished analyses of ground water were also obtained from other sources. The Salinity Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Riverside, Calif., furnished nine chemical analyses of samples from wells and springs in the Uinta Basin, Utah(L, V. Wilcox, written communication). MerrittChapman and Scott Corporation, Page, Ariz., furnished analytical data for six water samples collected from wells near the Glen Canyon dam. The Petroleum Research Corp., Denver, Colo., furnished seven chemical analyses of samples from wells on the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation (H. P. Walton, written communication). The laboratory that analyzed these samples is indicated by footnotes to the tables.
Sediment data in publications and files of the Geological Survey were used in preparing the monthly and annual summaries for the daily sediment stations. These publications are listed on page 6: In addition, some analyses of samples at miscellaneous sites were obtained from the files of the Geological Survey and from reconnaissance sampling in 1958. Sediment data were also obtained from a report by Fortier and Blaney (1928, p. 16, 17). The Bureau of Reclamation furnished unpublished data that had been collected at miscellaneous sites in connection with project investigations (E. O. Larsen, written communication). The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, furnished sediment data for test watersheds in the Fraser and Gunnison River basins (R. Price, personal communication), and the Agricultural Research Service furnished sediment data collected on Mexican Wash and tributaries in the San Juan River basin (J. E.

The isohyetal maps which take into account various physiographic factors were developed by E. L. Peck, Hydrologist-in-charge, Water Supply Forecast Unit, and M. J. Brown, State Climatologist, U.S. Weather Bureau, Salt Lake City, Utah. Previously such maps had been developed for that part of the Upper Colorado River Basin in western Colorado (Russier and Spreen, 1947), and northern Arizona (Hiatt, 1953, p. 186-206).
EXPLANATION OF TABLES
FLOW DURATION
Tables 1 to 174 are flow-duration tables of water discharge at 176 selected sites in the basin (pi. 1). The tables are listed by stations in downstream order. Along the main stem all stations on a tributary entering above a main-stem station are listed before the main-stem station. A similar order is followed in listing stations on first, second, and other ranks of tributaries. The station numbers are the same as those listed in the inventory of surface-water records.
The flow-duration tables show the number of days in each water year that the discharge was equal to, or greater than, the discharge listed at the head of the column, but less than the discharge listed at the head of the next column. The number of days of discharge in each class of selected values are shown together with the total cfs-days for each water year. A "cfs-day" is the volume of water represented by a flow of 1 cubic foot per second for 24 hours.
CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF SURFACE WATER

Publications of the Geological Survey and the following inventories were the primary source of data used in preparing the inventory of surface-water records.
Inventory of Published and Unpublished Chemical Analyses of Surface Waters in the Western United States: Notes on Hydrologic Activities Bull. 2, October 1948, and Bull. 9, September 1956; compiled under auspices of Subcommittee on Hydrologic Data; Federal Interagency River Basin Committee and published under the supervision of the Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Interior.

Tables 175 to 217 contain monthly and annual weighted averages of the analyses for the 41 daily chemical-quality stations. The weighted average of the analyses is the sum of the products of the discharges for the sampling periods and the quantities of the individual constituents for the corresponding periods divided by the sum of the discharges. Tables 218 to 226 contain chemical-quality analyses for the 850 miscellaneous sites. The sampling stations are listed in the same downstream order as described for the flow-duration tables. The station numbers are the same as those listed in the inventory of surfacewater records.

Inventory of Published and Unpublished Sediment- Samples were analyzed by methods regularly used Load Data in the United States: Sedimentation Bull. 1, in each laboratory. These methods are virtually the

EXPLANATION OF TABLES

same as, or are modifications of, methods described in publications for the mineral analysis of water (Collins, 1928, p. 235-266; Am. Public Health Assoc., 1960, p. 29-270; Rainwater and Thatcher, 1960).

The dissolved-mineral constituents are reported in parts per million (ppm) and equivalents per million (epm). A part per million is a unit weight of a constituent in a million unit weights of solution. An equivalent per million is a unit chemical combining weight of a constituent in a million unit weights of solution.

For many of the analyses, the value reported for dissolved solids is the sum of the quantities in parts per million of the various constituents, except bicarbonate, which is added after the bicarbonate is divided by 2.03. In other analyses, the value reported as dissolved solids, in parts per million, is the residue from evaporation of a water sample after the residue has been dried at 180°C for 1 hour.

The hardness, as calcium carbonate (CaCOa), is calculated by multiplying the sum of the equivalents of calcium and magnesium by 50.

Percent sodium is computed by dividing the equivalents per million of sodium by the sum of the equivalents per million of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, and multiplying the quotient by 100. In analyses where sodium and potassium were calculated and reported as a combined value, the value reported for percent sodium includes the equivalent quantity of potassium.

Determination of specific conductance was made a part of the analytical procedure after 1936. Specific conductance values are expressed in reciprocal ohms times 10 6 (micromhos at 25°C).

Hydrogen-ion concentration is expressed as pH units. The pH value of a solution is the negative logarithm of the gram ion hydrogen concentration.

Sodium-adsorption ratio (SAR)is the relative proportion of sodium to other cations in an irrigation water and is expressed by the equation:

SAR =

Na+

Ca++ Mg-H-

where the ionic concentrations are expressed in mil lequivalents per liter (or equivalents per million for most waters).
CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF GROUND WATER AND RELATED DATA
Tables 227 to 231 show the analyses of ground water from wells and springs in the Upper Colorado River Basin.

The analyses are listed by State and county. The order followed in the State listing is Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. The counties in each State are listed in alphabetical order, and the analyses in each county are listed in chronological order according to the date of collection in the field. Map numbers followed by the letter "G" are assigned to each analysis beginning with the first sample listed for Archuleta County, Colo. ' The sampling sites are identified by this map number on plate 1. If more than one sample was collected at the same place, the locality on the map is identified by more than one number.
The analyses are also given a code number. For some analyses this number is based upon the United States system of subdivision of public lands, and therefore it describes the geographic position of the sample point, generally to the nearest 160-acre tract. The method of assigning this number is illustrated by figure 1. Much of the region is not described by detailed maps, and the code numbers that identify many of the samples are therefore subject to change as more detailed maps become available.
In northern Arizona where large sections of land are unsurveyed the sample points are numbered in

4 WATER RESOURCES OF THE UPPER COLORADO RIVER BASIN BASIC DATA

compliance with a recording system adopted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. This number designates first, the grazing district in which the sample site is situated, and second, the accession order of the sample. However, in areas on the Indian reservation described by topographic maps but not surveyed by legal subdivisions, the analysis is numbered in accordance with its position with respect to the northeast corner of the topographic quadrangle map. A sample point described as 7.5 10.2 Boot Mesa quadrangle is thus 7.5 inches west and 10.2 inches south of the northeast corner of this quadrangle map.
The dissolved-mineral constituents are determined and reported in the same manner as those for surface water. The method used for computing sodium-adsorption ratio (SAR) differs somewhat from that described for surface water. In the analyses of ground water, sodium and potassium are usually combined and reported as sodium. In most ground water, potassium content is minor and its inclusion with sodium in the computation of SAR does not seriously affect the interpretation to be made from the figures calculated for SAR. However, when potassium is known to be large, the amount of potassium is indicated in a footnote and the SAR shown was calculated on the basis of sodium alone.
Some of the ground-water analyses were made in the field. Values obtained differed somewhat from corresponding analyses determined in the laboratory. The significance of these differences is not known. The data are included only to show the approximation of a partial analysis. These analyses were used mainly for guidance in the ground-water sampling program.
Data related to the chemical analyses are also shown in the tables. The source of the water sample, whether it be from a spring or a well, is indicated together with the corresponding water-bearing formation and the lithologic character of the waterbearing material. These geologic data come from many sources, including published reports that describe the geology in the vicinity of the sample sites; files of the State Engineers of the various States in the basin; and from field observations. The names of the various water-bearing formations are shown where the water-bearing unit could be identified; the table lists about 100 different water-bearing formations.
The lithologic character of the water-bearing formation is also indicated for each sample where this could be determined. The description of the clastic rocks conforms to the standards of Wentworth (1926); the color terms conform to those proposed by Goddard and others (1948). The lithologic descriptions are summarized from the geologic log of the

well, or, as many times is the case, they are taken from descriptions of the outcrop. These latter descriptions are used when the details of the stratigraphy indicate that the water-bearing formation is continuous for great distances and the well more than likely penetrates similar rocks.
The water type as shown by the tables is determined from the relative amounts in equivalents per million of the principal ions. Calcium, magnesium, and sodium (including potassium) ions are the principal cations and bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride ions are the principal anions. For example, if the concentration of sodium makes up more than 50 percent of the total cations and bicarbonate makes up more than 50 percent of the total anions, the water would be classified as "sodium bicarbonate water" (NaHCO3 ). In a bicarbonate water in which calcium, magnesium, and sodium were present in about equal concentration, the type would be given as "Ca, Mg, and Na HCO3 ," the cations being listed in order of relative concentration. However, where one of the three cations, magnesium for example, is one-half or greater than one-half of the magnitude of the most abundant cation, sodium, for example, then the type would be given as Na and Mg HCO3 . Similarly, if the third cation in order of magnitude is greater than one-half the second, then all three cations are listed in order of magnitude. The anions are considered in the same manner as the cations so that it is possible to have a Na HCO3 and Cl water, or an Na HCO3 , Cl, and SO4 water, depending upon the amount of the individual cations and the individual anions determined in the water sample.
SEDIMENT LOADS AND PARTICLE-SIZE ANALYSES
Tables 232 to 252 contain monthly and annual sediment loads for daily stations, tables 253 to 261 contain data on sediment loads at miscellaneous sites, and tables 262 to 290 are tables of particle-size analyses. The sampling stations are listed in the same downstream order as described for the flowduration tables, except the miscellaneous-sampling sites in the San Juan basin follow those in the Green River basin. The station numbers are the same as those listed in the inventory.
Sediment concentrations are expressed in parts per million by weight. Parts per million of sediment is computed by multiplying the ratio of the weight of sediment to the weight of the water-sediment mixture by 1,000,000. Sediment loads are expressed in tons per day and are obtained by multiplying the sediment concentration in parts per million by the water discharge in cubic feet per second, and multiplying this product by an appropriate conversion factor, usually 0.0027. Other conversion factors are given in the following table.

Particle-size analyses are expressed in percentages finer than indicated sizes in millimeters. Other data included in the tables of particle size are the date and time of collection, water discharge, sediment concentration, sediment discharge, and method of analysis.
Where records for daily stations were not complete, estimates of suspended-sediment load for days of missing record were made before summarizing the daily loads into monthly and annual quantities. These estimates were based on water discharge, sediment concentration observed immediately preceding and following the days of missing record, sediment loads for other periods of similar discharge, and sediment-water discharge correlations. The estimates were further guided by weather records and sediment loads for other stations.
INVENTORY OF SURFACE-WATER RECORDS
In the inventory of surface-water records (table 292), the names of stations and sites where records have been collected are listed in a downstream order. Station names for published records are given in their most recently published forms. Land-location descriptions for these stations may be obtained from Water-Supply Papers of the Geological Survey. For this report names have been adopted for some miscellaneous sites. Location descriptions for these miscellaneous sites are given in -table 293, which immediately follows the inventory.
The inventory has been prepared and keyed by station or site numbers to plate 1. Station numbers not followed by the letters "A" to"E" are the station identification numbers adopted by the Water Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey for regular streamflow stations. Chemical-quality and sediment stations operated at these streamflow stations are assigned the same number. For this report, station numbers followed by the letters "A" to "E" have been adopted for miscellaneous-sampling sites. These numbers are used as map numbers (pi. 1), and as station and site identification numbers in the tables of surface-water data.
The drainage areas given in table 292 are the latest figures published or otherwise available at this time. Those preceded by an "a" are approximate.

Periods of record of streamflow or reservoir content are indicated by calendar year in which the record began and ended; breaks of less than a 12-month period are not indicated. A dash not followed by a closing date indicates that the station was continued in operation beyond September 30, 1957. Periods of records other than continuous daily records are designated by the following symbols:
*Gage heights or gage heights and discharge measurements only. +Monthly figures of discharge or contents only. **Yearly figures of discharge only. ++Storm runoff for summer season only. ^Fragmentary record.
Periods or dates of record of chemical-quality and sediment records are indicated by the month and year in which the record began and ended or by the month and year of sample collection. A dash not followed by a closing date indicates that the station was continued in operation beyond September 30, 1957. Chemical-quality data collected at miscellaneous-sampling sites have been included through September 1958. The type of data available whether daily, periodic, or number of individual samples obtained and analyzed is indicated under "Frequency of sampling or number of analyses."
The reference number indicates the source or location of the data and the agency responsible for data collection and analysis. References are as follows:

EXPLANATION OF ISOHYETAL MAPS
The isohyetal lines on plates 2-4 show the average October to April, May to September, and annual precipitation in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The lines connect points of equal precipitation.
In the preparation of accurate isohyetal maps for areas like the Upper Colorado River Basin, consideration must be given to the topography and to storm patterns that bring moisture into the area. Generally, from about October through April, the principal source of precipitation is the Pacific Ocean. During the late spring and summer periods, much of the upper basin receives precipitation from moisture originating in the Gulf of Mexico. The effect of the topography of the drainage basin on the air masses that carry the moisture from the source regions into and across the drainage basin causes different precipitation patterns. Separate isohyetal maps for the periods October to April and May to September were prepared and then combined for an annual map. For some hydrologic studies the seasonal isohyetal maps are more useful than the annual maps.
October to April and May to September adjusted normals (average precipitation for the 1921 to 1950 period) were computed for all available precipitation records. In the derivation of the October to April normals for stations having 5 years or more of record, the double-mass technique was used. In making the double-mass analysis, the drainage basin was subdivided into 10 areas of climatic homogeniety. Correlations between precipitations and water equivalent of snow cover obtained at a network of 50 stations in Utah, operated mostly by the Soil Conservation Service, were used to estimate normal precipitation values for snow courses located above 8,000 feet elevation. Storage-gage precipitation data supplemented the information available at high elevations (U.S. Weather Bureau, 1958, 1960a-c). The May to September precipitation for short-term stations was adjusted to the 1921 to 1950 normals by developing average ratios to nearby long-term stations.

In small areas, there was good correlation between precipitation and station elevation for both the October to April and May to September periods. These correlation curves were used to estimate normal values at other points within the small areas where no precipitation data were available. Change in relationship of precipitation and elevation for some small adjacent areas was considerable where the areas were separated by high mountain ranges. By combining precipitation-elevation data for small areas, general precipitation-elevation curves for larger areas were obtained, and departures of individual station normals from these curves were plotted on base maps. Analysis of the departures showed that the direction and degree of departure were related to physiographic features. Normal May to September and October to April values were then determined for a grid of points over the drainage basin using the plotted departures and general relationships. These values together with the observed and adjusted normals were used to locate the October to April and May to September isohyetals. This procedure allowed for the large variations in normal precipitation due to topography while it retained the general precipitation-elevation relations for small areas. Graphical addition was used to derive the normal annual isohyetals from the two seasonal maps. A report being prepared by the Weather Bureau describes in detail the techniques employed in the preparation of these maps.
