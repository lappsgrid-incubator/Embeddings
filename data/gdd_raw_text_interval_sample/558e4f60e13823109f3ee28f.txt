INTRODUCTION
The U. S. Geological Survey is required by Congress (under Public Law 86-509) to provide Locatable Mineral Reports to the U. S. Forest Service whenever National Forest System lands are sold or exchanged. This volume is a compilation of the reports already provided to the Forest Service by the author in fiscal year 1998. Altogether, the reports describe the geology and resource potential of about 275 properties covering considerably more than 14,500 acres in 10 National Forests and 3 National Grasslands.
Locatable Mineral Reports must be generated promptly and provide complete and reliable information even though the sizes of land parcels and degree of difficulty in producing the reports varies. Each report must be researched and written using library resources, professional experience, and interviews with other geoscientists as appropriate no field work was conducted. The reports were not formally reviewed, but appropriate scientists were asked to give informal feedback before they were submitted to the Forest Service. Copies of the reports reside in U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Resource Program and U.S. Forest Service files.
Many of these land exchanges are for mutual convenience to gather both Federal and private lands into manageable blocks. Some are proposals by Towns, Counties, and States to enhance the "common good". Others are motivated by ranchers to improve their grazing lands and efficiency of their operations. Many recent land exchange offers are directed toward acquisition of public lands in high-value recreation areas (such as ski areas). The potential for litigation, controversy, and politics is much higher when land exchanges involve "high-value real estate" than when exchanges involve common grazing lands. Hence, locatable mineral reports must be reliable enough to withstand scrutiny of litigants vying for "high-stakes" real estate.
Thirteen reports are included in this volume. They are grouped by State, then alphabetically by Forest. Each reports starts with a cover letter followed by a page or more summarizing the locations of the properties (either verbatim or paraphrased from descriptions supplied by the Forest Service, designated Exhibits A and B). Geologic descriptions of the properties, mineral potential, and references comprise the main body of each report. Figures and attachments, if any, follow. The figures, normally photocopies of cited references, are provided only for the convenience of the Forest Service minerals examiner-they have not been redrafted.

Dear Mr. Prochazka:

This is in response to your July 14, 1998 request for information on locatable mineral resources for the land exchange proposal in which Mike Cervi has offered certain non-Federal lands within the Pawnee National Grassland, administered by the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, in exchange for Federal lands also within the Pawnee National Grassland.

In accordance with the working agreement under Public Law 86-509,1 am providing you with a report on the locatable mineral resources on the lands described in Exhibits "A" and "B", included with your request. These lands comprise an unspecified number of acres in Weld County, Colorado.

Sincerely yours,

Anna B. Wilson, Geologist Mineral Resource Surveys, Central Region

LOCATABLE MINERAL REPORT FOR MIKE CERVI LAND EXCHANGE OFFER,
PAWNEE NATIONAL GRASSLAND, ARAPAHO AND ROOSEVELT NATIONAL FORESTS,-
WELD COUNTY, COLORADO
By Anna B. Wilson U.S. Geological Survey
August 28, 1998

Thefollowing report is based on information contained in USGS mineral resource and commodityfiles, mineral information databases (MRDS and MAS), and on reports and maps available in the USGS library. These are occasionally augmented with unpublished documents and personal experiences. No field studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only if they appear in the above documents. Mineral resource assessments are subjective: the opinions expressed herein are entirely those ofthe author.

NON-FEDERAL AND FEDERAL LANDS
Fourteen Parcels in Pawnee National Grassland (Dipper Spring, Battle Canyon, Avalo 1:24,000, Sterling 1:100,000 and 1:250,000 quadrangles)
All of the parcels considered for exchange are in the Denver basin in the vicinity of the Chalk Bluffs, north of the South Platte River (Scott, 1978) in northeastern Weld County, Colorado.
The three northern-most parcels are within the upper part of the fluvial Miocene Ogallala Formation (Scott, 1978; see figure 1). The six east-central parcels are predominantly in fluvial Oligocene White River Formation overlying the upper transition member of the marine Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale (Scott, 1978). The five southernmost parcels are in White River Formation and are locally overlain by Pre-Bull lake age gravels and alluvium of the Pleistocene Slocum Alluvium (Scott, 1978).
Elsewhere in the Great Plains region, Pierre Shale is locally host to bentonite, marine fossils, uranium, and manganese nodules (Scott, 1978). The parcels should be examined for these commodities and possible sand and gravel deposits. There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the parcels (USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential for metallic mineral deposits is low.
The tracts are within the oil and gas producing Denver basin. There are several oil fields, gas fields (Scott, 1978; see figure 2), and numerous oil and gas wells in the vicinity. The tracts are within or very close to areas identified in the National Oil and Gas Assessment as oil and gas plays. Specific details can be found in Gautier and others, 1996, Beeman and others, 1996, and Charpentier and others, 1996. At the scale of the assessment and available data, it can not be within the scope of this report to determine which parcels have greater or lesser oil and gas potential. Oil and gas potential is high for most of the tracts.

LOCATABLE MINERAL REPORT FOR THE CRESTED BUTTE MOUNTAIN RESORT LAND EXCHANGE OFFER, GUNNISON NATIONAL FOREST, GUNNISON COUNTY, COLORADO
The following report is based on information contained in USGS mineral resource and commodityfiles, mineral information databases (MRDS and MAS), and on reports and maps available in the USGS library. These are occasionally augmented with other unpublished documents, personal communications, andprofessional experiences. No field studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only ifthey appear in the above documents. Geoenvironmental and geohazards are included where geology and readily available data combine to create a local situation that should not be overlooked.
NON FEDERAL LANDS: (With one exception, all properties are on Gunnison 1:100,000 and Montrose 1:250,000 quadrangles. Parcel 13, Group B, Map 18, Caro Claim, is on Leadville 1:100,000 and 1:250,000 quadrangles)
Parcel 1: Gothic (Map 1; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)
The Gothic parcel is on the southwest flank of the White Rock pluton (Oligocene granodiorite) and includes the south- to southwesterly-dipping Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata it intruded. Rock units include the Upper part of the Gothic Formation (Middle Pennsylvanian), Maroon Formation (Lower Permian and Upper and Middle Pennsylvanian), Entrada Sandstone (Middle Jurassic), Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Burro Canyon Formation (Lower Cretaceous), and Dakota Sandstone (Upper Cretaceous) (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment A). Miocene rhyolite porphyry dikes cut most of the rock types.
The parcel contains one or two unnamed prospects, the Usona tunnel which is an uncompleted crosscut to mines in Queen Basin, and the Copper Glance mill site patented claim (see #51 and #37, respectively, Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachments B and C). The Silver Bell claim, at the head of Queen Basin, which contains at least four other patented claims (Copper Queen, Silver Queen, Copper Glance, and Iron Duke; see attachment C; and DC00703; see attachment D) extends into the parcel. No production has been recorded (Weisner and Bieniewski, 1984, p. 34, and fig 15, p. 77) from these claims. The workings are small and mineralized material in the veins is discontinuous. Weisner and Bieniewski concluded that there was insufficient evidence to define a resource due to lack of prospects and exposed mineralized material.
A brief description of the Copper Queen claim (Weisner and Bieniewski, 1984) suggests that silver, copper (argentiferous tetrahedrite, azurite, and malachite), sphalerite, galena, and calcite occurred in sub-economic quantities along sheared and brecciated bedding planes in metasedimentary rocks.

January 27, 1998

The mineral resource potential for similar vein-type deposits in the Gothic parcel is high. Mineral resource potential along the contact with the White Rock Pluton and the Gothic (?) Formation (see attachments A and B) in the northern part of the parcel is low for skarn deposits containing low grade deposits of copper similar to those near the head of Conundrum Pass, at the head of Copper Creek in the Maroon Bells quadrangle (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998).
Parcel 2: Boris (Map 2; Pitkin 1:24,000 quadrangle)
Geologic mapping (Horlacher, 1987, 1:12,000; see attachment E) indicates that the Boris parcel is underlain by a northwest-striking, steeply-dipping succession of Early Proterozoic amphibolite interlayered with a supracrustal sequence of layered metasedimentary rocks, and metamorphosed basaltic greenstone, felsic volcanic rock, basaltic tuff breccia, and local minor rock types such as metachert, calcite-actinolite rock, calcitic marble, and spotted chloritecummingtonite-cordierite rock. A northwest striking fault drops down the northeast corner of the parcel and reveals poorly exposed Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that include Upper Cambrian Sawatch Sandstone and Lower Ordovician Manitou Dolomite. The southern part of the tract is overlain by Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation and Junction Creek Sandstone, and Cretaceous Dakota Group in a south-dipping questa. The supracrustal package is bounded about 2 mi to the east by synkinematic Roosevelt granite and about 2 mi to the west by the coarse-grained, postkinematic Granite of Wood Gulch (Horlacher, 1987, p. 86).
The parcel includes the Revenue mine (Horlacher, 1987; Crawford and Worcester, 1916; U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, DC01143; see attachment F) and an unnamed mine (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, #DC01142; see attachment G) and is located just east of the Quartz Creek Pegmatite district (Staatz and Trites, 1955).
The Revenue mine, a greenstone-hosted vein-type gold deposit (Horlacher, 1987, p. 92), extracted gold from a 1400-ft vein in schistose amphibolite. The mineralized zone strikes northwest and dips about 65° to the southwest, and is subparallel to lithologic contacts, schistosity, and a shear zone (Horlacher, 1987, p. 107). Sulfides make up less than about 10% of the vein minerals. Opaque minerals observed include pyrite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, and trace sphalerite, and secondary bornite and covellite after chalcopyrite (Horlacher, 1987, p. 111). In the oxidized zone, pyrite is altered to limonite and part of the ore is copper-stained (Crawford and Worcester, 1916, p. 110-111). Apparently, gold concentrations ranged from about 0.1 oz/ton in unoxidized ore to 3.0 oz/ton in oxidized ore (Horlacher, 1987, p. 92-93). No production records could be located for this area.
The unnamed mine is associated with roads and prospects at the west edge of the parcel. The deposit probably is a similar gold occurrence although the database (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, #DC01142; see attachment G) also lists silver as a resource.

January 27, 1998

As recently as 1983, Minerals Inc., Golden, Colorado, was actively renovating the workings and exploring for gold at the Revenue mine. They completed a 95 ft drift "on a narrow, gold-bearing zone in sheared amphibolite" but soon thereafter the mine flooded (Horlacher, .1987, p. 93). The exploration work noted that the highest gold concentrations were in narrow shear zones and altered rock enveloping the quartz veins and confirmed the earlier reported range of gold concentrations.
There is high mineral resource potential for similar, mostly small, discontinuous, low grade gold-silver vein deposits on the Parcel.
Pegmatite bodies have been widely prospected in the area nearby, but few, if any, were economic producers. No pegmatite bodies are mapped on the property. The potential for pegmatite bodies on the property is low.
Parcel 3: Upper Loop (Map 3; Gothic and Crested Butte 1:24,000 quadrangles)
Slopes of Quaternary debris conceal Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale overlain by quartz monzonite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry of the Oligocene Crested Butte Laccolith that crops out immediately to the east (Gaskill and others, 1986, 1991; see attachments H and I).
No mineralized material is known on this parcel and mineral resource potential is low.
Slope stability should be of concern on this parcel. The debris slopes are mostly forested talus, talus streams and protalus ramparts derived from the Crested Butte laccolith. Structures that indicate mass movement have been mapped in this area and include landslides or slump blocks, and debris-earthflow tongues (Gaskill and others, 1986, 1991).
Parcel 4: Almont (Map 4; Almont and Flat Top 1:24,000 quadrangles)
Parcel 4 (Sec. 16) is primarily underlain by Quaternary surficial deposits overlying Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale, Dakota Sandstone, and Burro Canyon Formation, Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, and possibly some Middle Jurassic Junction Creek Sandstone (Ellis and others, 1987; see attachment J). A northwest striking fault cuts the southwest corner of the parcel uplifting the corner. Immediately south of the parcel offset is sufficient to repeat the Dakota Sandstone, and Burro Canyon and Morrison Formations but due to Quaternary surficial deposits the offset is not obvious on the parcel.
None of these rock units is known for hosting mineral deposits in this immediate area. Uranium does occur in Morrison Formation, there are thin coal beds in the Dakota Sandstone, and there are sand and gravel deposits in Quaternary gravels and alluvium elsewhere in the region. Most of the coal production from this region is from the Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde Formation

January 27, 1998

which overlies the Mancos Shale and is higher in the stratigraphic section than is present in the parcel. Mineral resource potential of this parcel is low.
The slopes underlain by Mancos Shale should be examined for stability. As mapped, the Quaternary surficial deposits unit (Ellis and others, 1987, unit Qs) includes several units that are individually mapped in the Crested Butte quadrangle (Gaskill and others, 1986). In the Crested Butte quadrangle, these units show signs of active landslides, debris flows, and other indications of mass movement.
Parcel 5: Red Mountain (Map 5; Crested Butte 1:24,000 and Flat Top 1:24,000 quadrangles)
Parcel 5 is underlain by Quaternary debris slopes and landslide, slump, debris-earthflow complexes mantled with basalt rubble and colluvium. Most of the debris is derived from lava flows on Red Mountain and slope failure in surficial debris and shaly or clayey bedrock. The slopes are underlain by Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale (Ellis and others, 1987, see attachment J; Gaskill and others, 1986, see attachment K).
None of these rock units is known for hosting mineral deposits in this area. Mineral resource potential of this parcel is low.
Slope stability should be of concern on this parcel. Active mass movement features are mapped in the northern part of the parcel (Gaskill and others, 1986: see attachment K) and in all likelihood extend into the southern part.
Parcel 6: East Beaver Creek (Map 6; Almont and Crystal Creek 1:24,000 quadrangles)
Detailed geologic mapping of this parcel is lacking. The only available geologic mapping that covers this parcel is the Montrose 1° x 2° quadrangle (Tweto and others, 1976; see attachment L). Only the eastern-most part of the parcel is included on the western-most part of two maps by DeWitt and others: a simplified geologic map (1985), and an unpublished map (1:30,000 scale) and manuscript of the Fossil Ridge and surrounding area (Ed DeWitt, U.S. Geological Survey, oral and written communications, December 1997) intended for publication as a U.S. Geological Survey I-Map. By extrapolation from the three maps and from discussion with Ed DeWitt (written and oral communication, January 14, 1998; see attachment M), the parcel appears to be at the contact of Early Proterozoic Henry Mountain Granite and Early Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks. Locally, Pliocene and Miocene gravel and alluvial deposits may overlie the Proterozoic rocks.
No mines or prospects are known in the area. Mineral resource potential is low.

Parcel 7: North Flattop (Map 7; Flat Top 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Parcel 7 is underlain by Quaternary landslide material overlying Upper Cretaceous . Mancos Shale (Tweto and others, 1976; Ellis and others, 1987, see attachment J).

No mines or prospects are known on this parcel. Mineral resource potential is low.

The slopes underlain by Mancos Shale should be examined for stability. As mapped, the Quaternary surficial deposits unit (Ellis and others, 1987, unit Qs) includes several units that are individually mapped in the Crested Butte quadrangle (Gaskill and others, 1986). In the Crested Butte quadrangle, these units show signs of active landslides, debris flows, and other indications of mass movement.

Parcel 8: Rarick Gulch (Map 8; Almont and Cement Mtn 1:24,000 quadrangles)

The only readily available geologic mapping that covers this parcel is the Montrose 1° x 2° quadrangle (Tweto and others, 1976; see attachment L). On the basis of unpublished mapping and field observations by Ed DeWitt (U.S. Geological Survey, oral communication, January, 1998), Rarick Gulch is probably entirely underlain by the Middle Proterozoic Taylor River Granite, a 1.4 Ga, peraluminous pluton.

No mines, prospects, or mineral occurrences are known on this parcel or in similar rocks nearby. Mineral potential for pegmatite bodies containing light rare-earth element commodities is low (Ed DeWitt, U.S. Geological Survey, oral communication, January, 1998).

Parcel 9: Eagle Ridge (Map 7; Flat Top 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The Eagle Ridge Parcel is mapped as Quaternary landslide material that probably overlies Upper Cretaceous Mancos Shale (Tweto and others, 1976; Ellis and others, 1987, see attachment J). The slopes underlain by Mancos Shale should be examined for stability. As mapped, the Quaternary surficial deposits unit (Ellis and others, 1987, unit Qs) includes several units that are individually mapped in the Crested Butte quadrangle (Gaskill and others, 1986). In the Crested Butte quadrangle, these units show signs of active landslides, debris flows, and other indications of mass movement.

No mines or prospects are known on this parcel. Mineral resource potential is low.

Parcel 10: South Flattop (Map 9; Flat Top 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The South Flattop Parcel is mapped as Quaternary landslide material. Quaternary gravel and alluvium may cover the southwestern parts, along Ohio Creek (Tweto and others, 1976; Ellis and others, 1987, see attachment J). Mancos Shale probably underlies the Quaternary deposits.

C:\..AIocmin\Iocmin23.wpd

January 27, 1998

The slopes underlain by Mancos Shale should be examined for stability. As mapped, the Quaternary surficial deposits unit (Ellis and others, 1987, unit Qs) includes several units that are individually mapped in the Crested Butte quadrangle (Gaskill and others, 1986). In the Crested Butte quadrangle, these units show signs of active landslides, debris flows, and other indications of mass movement.

No mines or prospects are known on this parcel. Mineral resource potential is low.

Parcel 11 and Parcel D: Brush Creek (Map 10; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Numerous small tracts of land on both sides of East River comprise these Parcels. In general, the parcels are underlain by Cretaceous Mancos Shale mantled by Quaternary surficial deposits. The Quaternary units include alluvial, alluvial fan, debris flow, landslide, slump-scarp, debris slope, earthflow, and moraine deposits (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment N).

No mines or prospects are known on the Parcels. Mineral resource potential for locatable commodities is low. The northwestern-most tract of Parcel D should be examined for sand and gravel potential. The southeastern-most tract of Parcel 11 should be examined for active landslide, slump, debris-flow, and earthflow complexes.

Parcel 12: West Virginia Lode (Map 12; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The West Virginia Lode is in the Oligocene granodiorite of the Copper Creek Sill. Apparently the sill has slightly different texture and composition from the nearby (and mineralized) White Rock Pluton (Gaskill and others, 1991, #27; see attachment A).

The West Virginia, like its neighbors Virginia, Mineral King, Ophir, Ella Wood, and Frank, was probably a low-grade silver deposit (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, part of DC00723, see attachment O; Gaskill and others, 1991, #27-32 on map and p. 3; see attachments B and C). The only activity reported was in 1879. Only a few hundred feet to the northeast, the Virginia Lode (DC00722, see attachment L; Gaskill and others, 1991, #28) contained silver, gold, copper, lead, and zinc and operated from 1879 to 1906, and again in 1947 and 1955. Mineralization in the region appears to be associated with the White Rock Pluton and not the Copper Creek Sill.

Mineral resource potential for small polymetallic veins enriched in silver is high.

Parcel 13: Lode Claims

Group A: Quartz Creek Area (#1-3 on Map 12, Fairview Peak 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The area is Early Proterozoic Fairview Granodiorite (DeWitt and others, unpublished map and manuscript of the Fossil Ridge and surrounding area) overlain by Paleozoic strata including

C:\..Alocmin\locmin23.wpd

21

January 27, 1998

Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite (Sandstone); Ordovician Manitou Dolomite (Limestone), Harding Sandstone, and Fremont Limestone; Devonian Parting Quartzite member and Chaffee Group; Mississippian Leadville Limestone; and Pennsylvanian Belden and Minturn Formations (Rosenlund, 1984, see attachment Q; terminology from Tweto and others, 1976 and Tweto and others, 1978).

The claims appear to be associated with the Fairview (DC01243 and 80510124; see attachments R and S) and Cleopatra mines (DC01244; see attachment T). In this area, the known mineral deposits are replacement manto deposits of galena and sphalerite in dolomitic beds. The ore is usually in the dolomite just below the "Fairview" shale (Hill, 1909, p. 34*35). Rosenlund (1984, table 6, p. 73-74) equates the dolomite beds to the Fremont Dolomite immediately underlying the basal shales of the Parting Member of the Chaffee Group.

Ore in the district is mostly "argentiferous galena, with possibly some stephanite, and gray copper" (Hill, 1909, p. 35). At the Fairview mine, crystallized galena was "surrounded by a very fine grained dark mineral [...] which reacts like galena but contains a large percentage of silver; [...] and is surrounded by lead and copper carbonates" (Hill, 1909, p. 35).

At the Fairview mine, the ore consists of galena and cerussite with minor sphalerite, malachite, and azurite concentrated along the nose of a tightly folded east-trending anticline (Herald, 1981). Rosenlund (1984, p. 75) identified galena (replaced by chalcocite, covellite, malachite, and cerussite), chalcopyrite (replaced by neodigenite(?)), pyrite (replaced by geothite and lepidocrocite), sphalerite, azurite, malachite, covellite, and tetrahedrite in samples from the Fairview mine and New Dollar tunnel (Rosenlund, 1984, p. 74). How the New Dollar tunnel, completed in 1983 (Rosenlund, 1984), connects with the preexisting workings is unclear.

Mineral resource potential for additional small silver-bearing replacement deposits is high. Due to the presence of carbonate minerals, principally calcite, lack of pyrite, and the oxidized nature of the deposits, the potential for acid mine drainage is low. Bad air is common in mines in the district (CO2 is released from the carbonate); any mine openings could present a hazard if entered.

Group B: Tavlor Pass Area (#1-3 and 4-6 on Map 13, Pearl Pass 1:24,000 quadrangle; only claim shown on Map 18, New York Peak 1:24,000 quadrangle)

(Map 18. only claim shown; New York Peak 1:24.000 quadrangle)

The Caro Claim is in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness Area, on the southeast flank of Gold Hill in the headwaters of Bowman Creek (Baskin, 1987). The claim is a few miles west of the Grizzly Peak Caldera. The claim is in Early Proterozoic metasedimentary gneiss (Fridrich and others, 1997; see attachment U) in close proximity to 1.4-Ga granitic rocks, overlain by Pleistocene glacial deposits.

C:\..Alocmin\locmin23.wpd

22

January 27, 1998

No workings are shown in the immediate vicinity of the claim. The claim was not sampled (Baskin, 1987). Mineral resource potential for small precious metal veins in Proterozoic rocks is moderate.
(#4-6 on Map 13, Pearl Pass 1:24,000 quadrangle)
The M&M and Robert L. claims are in the Pearl Pass quadrangle on the north flank of Mount Tilton. Rock units in this area are predominantly Lower Mississippian Leadville Limestone through Upper Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite in fault contact with Early Proterozoic Granite of Henry Mountain (Fridrich and others, 1997; see attachment U).
There are a number of small prospects and mines in the area. These include the Ender (a.k.a. Climax) mine (Slebir, 1957; DC00692, 80510096; see attachments V and W) and Red Cloud mine (Slebir, 1957).
Based on the presence of several small mines and prospects in the vicinity, mineral resource potential of this property is moderate for small veins and replacement deposits of baseand precious-metals.
(#1-3. Map 13, Pearl Pass 1:24.000 quadrangle)
The Mount Vernon, Silvertip, and Charles H. claims are on Lambertson Peak where Oligocene rocks of the 33-34 Ma Italian Mountain Complex intrude Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Cunningham, 1976, see attachment X; Fridrich and others, 1997, see attachment U). Most of the Paleozoic rocks are contact metamorphosed (Cunningham, 1976). In general, Pennsylvanian Gothic, Belden, and Molas Formations are in the southern part of the parcel and Mississippian Leadville Limestone through Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite are in the northern part. Quartz monzonite underlies most of the rest of the property.
Three intrusive centers compose the Italian Mountain Complex (Cunningham, 1976). The southern and central centers are simple plutons. The Mount Vernon, Silvertip, and Charles H. claims are within the northernmost and youngest composite pluton which is composed of four generally concentric rock types (Cunningham, 1976). In addition to observing that the intrusive rocks contain "halite-bearing fluid inclusions with dense, saline fluids ~ a feature shared with 28 out of 30 porphyry copper deposits of the western United States", Cunningham (1976) notes that
hydrothermal ore deposits have been mined from breccia zones and replacement deposits in the Leadville Limestone near the Italian Mountain Intrusive Complex for nearly a century. The deposits, which form a rough zonal pattern, are close to the northern intrusive center. Sulfide ores are richest in zinc and copper near the intrusive mass and in lead and silver farther away. The zoning and the spatial

association indicate that the hydrothermal sulfides are related to the northern intrusive center.
A vague record in the MRDS database (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, #DC00693; see attachment Y) suggests that the Mount Vernon, Silvertip, and Charles H. claims, along with the Climax and Mascot, constitute a lead-zinc-silver deposit. No other information is given.
Mineral resource potential for small lead-zinc-silver veins, replacement bodies, or porphyry copper deposits on these claims is moderate.
Group C: Cumberland Pass Area (#4-7, Map 12; Fairview Peak 1:24,000 quadrangle)
The area is mapped as Early Proterozoic Fairview Granodiorite overlain by Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite, intruded by Oligocene Porphyry of Green Mountain, and locally covered by Holocene and Pleistocene alluvial and glacial deposits (Rosenlund, 1984, see attachment Q; DeWitt and others, unpublished map and manuscript, December, 1997; DeWitt and others, 1985).
Small mines and prospects are in the vicinity. Veins in the Cambrian Sawatch Formation at the Little Anna mine are related to the Oligocene Porphyry of Green Mountain. Mineral resource potential for small polymetallic veins in Proterozoic rocks and Cambrian Sawatch Quartzite is moderate.
Group D: Whitepine Area (Whitepine and Garfield 1:24.000, and Garfield 1:62,500 quadrangles)
(#1. Mapl4. Whitepine 1:24,000 quadrangle)
The Healsburg claim plots just east of Egg Rock Creek in granite similar in composition to the 1.4 Ga Silver Plume Granite (Dings and Robinson, 1957; see attachment Z). Several prospects are shown in the area (Dings and Robinson, pi. 1; see attachment Z) but there is no mention of production. It is possible that this claim is along the projected strike of another vein in the area, or it could be a "blind structure" in the granite similar to the Star or Morning Glim fault (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998).
Mineral resource potential for small base- and precious-metal vein deposits in the granite is low to moderate.
(#2,3, Map 14, Whitepine 1:24,000 quadrangle)
The Mayflower and Caladonia claims are underlain by Quaternary moraine that mantles the Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite (40 Ma). These claims are directly over the haulage

tunnels of some of the productive mines in the area but there are no productive mines on the south end of Porcupine Ridge (Dings and Robinson, 1957, pis. 1 and 5; see attachment Z).

Mineral resource potential for small base- and precious-vein deposits in the Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite is low.

(#4.5. Map 14. Whitepine 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Both the Flirt (#4) and Hawkeye (#5) (not the Hawkeye of Dings and Robinson, 1957, which is on the east side of the Continental Divide) are at the contact of granite-similar in composition to the 1.4 Ga Silver Plume Granite and the 40 Ma Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite (see attachment Z). This contact was the extension of the Morning Glim fault before the fault was intruded by the Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite. The Flirt (#4) is near the Lilly mine on the northeast side of Graveyard Gulch and the Hawkeye (#5) is at the headwaters of Graveyard Creek.

Mineral resource potential for small base- and precious-metal deposits in veins is low.

(#6-10. Map 14, Whitepine 1:24.000 quadrangle)

The Spar Copper mine (DC01196 and 80510265; see attachments AA and BB) includes the Morning Glim (DC01200 and 80510237; see attachments CC and DD), Ensign (DC01191 , 80510120; see attachments EE and FF), and Parole tunnels (DC01198, 80510266; see attachments GG and HH), and the Morning Glim, Spar, Jersey, Snowden, Ensign, Iron Duke, and Bob Lee patented claims (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 75; see map 14). The tunnels worked the Spar Copper vein and supposedly produced about 4,800 tons of ore (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 75). The ore is on both sides of the Morning Glim fault which places 1.4-Ga(?) granite on the east over shale of the Pennsylvanian Belden Formation on the west. East of the fault, ore is in a vein in the granite. West of the fault, replacement ore deposits are in marble layers in the Belden Formation (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 75; see attachments Z and II). Mineralization is related to evolution of the Morning Glim Fault which appears to be about 70 Ma (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998). The Morning Glim fault is intruded by 40-Ma Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite at the north end of the Iron King workings (see attachments Z and II).

Minerals reported on the property include quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, enargite, and native copper (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 76). The mine produced copper, lead, silver and gold (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 75). Bodies of magnetite and limonite iron ore have been reported in the northern part of this claim group (Harder, 1909, p. 195-198).

There is high mineral resource potential for similar small vein and replacement deposits containing base- and precious-metals on these claims.

(#1.2. Map 15: Whitepine 1:24.000 quadrangle)
Both claims are near the head of Canyon Creek on the northwest side of Stella Mountain. The Lippincott claim (#1) appears to be entirely within Tertiary Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite (Dings and Robinson, 1957; see attachment Z). The Blue Bell (#2) is in the Pennsylvanian and Permian Belden and Minturn Formations (Dings and Robinson, 1957).
High metamorphic grade skarn in the area is probably related both to diorite of probable Late Cretaceous age and Oligocene Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998). A small thrust duplex(?) to the west suggests a complex structural geometry (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998).
A number of small prospects are in the area, but there is no recorded production, nor indications that any ever occurred. Mineral resource potential for small vein deposits in Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite on the Lippincott claim is low. Mineral resource potential for small skarn deposits in Pennsylvanian Belden Formation on the Blue Bell claim is low.
(#3 A. Map 15: Whitepine 1:24.000 quadrangle)
Both claims are near the head of Tomichi Creek on the east side of Granite Mountain. The Little Maudie claim (#3) is entirely within the Mount Princeton Quartz Monzomte (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990; see attachment JJ, #15-3) near an area where roughly north-striking vertical to steeply west-dipping veins are mapped (Dings and Robinson, 1957; see attachment Z). The Gipsy (#4) appears to follow a north-striking, steeply west-dipping, quartz-fluorite vein (Dings and Robinson, 1957) in the 40-Ma Mount Princeton Quartz Monzomte on the west margin of the Mount Aetna Quartz Monzonite which forms a ring dike at the margin of the Mount Aetna caldera (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990, see attachment JJ, #15-4; Shannon, 1988). Mineralization is related to the 34-35 Ma subsidence of Mt. Aetna caldera or slightly younger (Shannon, 1988).
A number of small prospects are in the area, but other than $2000 worth of gold and $500 worth of silver produced from the Lewiston-Pet (# 90 on attachment Z; DC01174, see attachment KK) which is in Buckhorn Creek, south of the Little Maudie claim, there is no recorded production (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 79-81), nor indications that any ever occurred. Other nearby mines include the Hiawatha (#71 on attachment Z; DC01172, see attachment LL), Day Star (# 32 on attachment Z; DC01169, see attachment MM), and Magna Charta Tunnel (# 105 on attachment Z; DC01175, see attachment NN). Records for these are incomplete. The Hiawatha is credited with pyrite and minor galena and sphalerite on the dump (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 80). Fluorite, and scarce chalcopyrite, pyrite, calcite, and stephanite (brittle silver) were reported on the dump of the Day Star (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 79). Pyrite, and sparse galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite were reported on the dump of the Magna Charta (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 81).

Mineral resource potential for similar small precious-metal-bearing veins is low on the Little Maudie claim but moderate on the Gipsy claim which is at the caldera margin where orebearing fluids could potentially have circulated more freely (Ed DeWitt, written communication, January, 1998).
(#1-4. Map 16: Garfield 1:24.000 quadrangle)
All four claims are east of the Akron mine, south and east of Lake Hill. The host rocks are in a stratigraphic package ranging from 1.4-Ga granite through the Pennsylvanian-Permian Belden and Minturn Formation (Dings and Robinson, 1957; see attachments Z and NN). The 1.4Ga granite is thrust over the Paleozoic rocks by the Morning Glim Fault (Dings and Robinson, 1957; Ed DeWitt, written communication, see attachment OO).
The closest mine, the Annie Hudson (# 6 on attachment Z; DC01199, see attachment PP), along the Morning Glim fault, probably had small, though unrecorded, production (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 78). Production was apparently from a replacement body in limestone of the Belden Formation adjacent to the fault zone. Smithsonite (ZnCO3), calamine (also known as hemimorphite: Zn4(Si2O7)(OH2)2 H2O), and galena are reported. Ore assayed in 1910 averaged 41% Zn and 5.25 opt Ag (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 78). Numerous small prospects cover the claim area, but none is named nor described in the literature.
Mineral resource potential for similar small veins or replacement bodies of silver, lead, and zinc is moderate.
(#1-13. Map 17: Garfield 1:24.000 quadrangle)
Claims 1-4 are on the west slope of Clover Mountain, east and topographically above the Legal Tender mine (# 89, Dings and Robinson, 1957 and p. 80, see attachment Z; Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990, see attachment JJ) near the head of Robbins Creek.
Megabreccia composed mainly of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990; see attachment JJ) is the dominant lithology in the area of the claims. It is immediately north of Precambrian granite (Silver Plume equivalent), and west of Oligocene Sewanee Peak Volcanics, Mount Aetna Quartz Monzonite, and a small exposure of Precambrian augen gneiss on the southwestern margin of the Mount Aetna caldera (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990; see attachment JJ; Shannon, 1988)
The Legal Tender (DC01208; see attachment QQ) was probably a partially oxidized irregular replacement deposit of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, smithsonite, anglesite, and sparse chalcopyrite, and malachite in blocks of megabreccia. No production was recorded.

Mineral resource potential for claims 1 -4 is high for low grade deposits in extensively shattered rocks.
Claim 5 (Modoc 1 & 2) is immediately northeast of the Bill Short mine (#13, Dings and Robinson, 1957, see attachment Z). Unlike all the other claims on Map 17, the Modoc 1 & 2 is underlain by Precambrian granite and Oligocene Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite and Mount Aetna Quartz Monzonite (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990; see attachment JJ).
The Bill Short mine (DC01178; see attachment RR), on trend with the Modoc, and in the same host rocks, was still accessible in 1949 and had produced 14 tons of ore that yielded 158 oz Au, 357 oz Ag, 157 pounds Cu, 712 pounds Pb, and 1,879 pounds Zn (Dings and Robinson, 1957, p. 78). The veins strike roughly north-northeast and dip steeply to the west in altered Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite and altered 1.4-Ga(?) granite. Pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and minor greenockite (CdS) have been reported (Dings and Robinson, 1957).
Mineral resource potential for similar small low grade base- and precious-metal veins in Mount Princeton Quartz Monzonite on claim 5 is high.
Claims 6-9 and 11-13 are on the west flank of Vulcan Mountain between Robbins Creek and Deer Gulch. The claims are primarily in Oligocene megabreccia including volcanic breccia and tuff breccia on the western margin of the Mount Aetna caldera (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990, see attachment JJ; Shannon, 1988). Claims 9 and 13 are mostly underlain by Mount Aetna Quartz Monzonite Porphyry. Claims 11 & 12 and the northern part of claim 9 are in a portion of the megabreccia composed predominantly of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 1990; see attachment JJ). Mineral resource potential for small low-grade baseand precious-metal veins is moderate to high on claims 6-9 and low for claims 11-13.
An incomplete record in the MRDS database (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, D000434; see attachment UU) indicates that this area was prospected by AMAX for molybdenite. Resources or reserves were estimated at 100 Ibs Mo at 0.01% Mo. No other mention is made of molybdenum in this area. Potential for a Mo deposit within 1 km of the surface is very low. Mineral resource potential for low grade porphyry molybdenum at substantial depth is moderate.
Claim #10, Oddie, appears to be located at or near the Fort Scott mine. The claim is underlain by megabreccia near the contact with Mount Aetna Quartz Monzonite Porphyry (Toulmin and Hammarstrom, 19990). The Fort Scott (DC01170, DC01171; see attachments SS and TT) probably produced 10-12 carloads of gold and silver ore prior to 1901. The vein probably was north-striking in altered welded tuff. Gold-bearing pyrite and galena were the most probable ore minerals.
Mineral resource potential for small base- and precious-metal veins is low.

FEDERAL LANDS: (All properties are on Gunnison 1:100,000 and Montrose 1:250,000 quadrangles)

Parcel A: North (Map 3; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Parcel A is underlain, almost entirely, by undifferentiated Pleistocene moraine deposits containing at least three mapped moraine ridges and undifferentiated surficial deposits, all overlying Cretaceous Mancos Shale. Landslides or slump scarps are prominent on the northeast margin of the tract (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment VV).

No mines or prospects are known in this area. Mineral resource potential is low for all beatable and leasable deposit types. There is moderate potential for sand and gravel deposits. Landslide potential, however, is enormous, both because the Mancos Shale that underlies the tract is landslide prone, and because the quartz monzonite and granodiorite porphyry of the Snodgrass laccolith that crop out on the hillsides above, form talus slopes that creep downhill towards the tract. Talus streams and earthflow lobes are visible on the slopes above.

Parcel B: West (Map 3; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Parcel B is entirely within Quaternary landslide, slump, debris-flow, and earthflow deposits (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment VV). Mapped landslide and slump blocks and surficial debris forming arcuate lobes and ridges, are indications of mass movement typical of unstable slopes.

No mines or prospects are known in this area. Mineral resource potential for all locatable and leasable deposit types is low. There is moderate potential for sand and gravel deposits.

Parcels C and F: East and Central (Map 3; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Parcels C and F form a contiguous irregular-shaped block that covers about one sq. mi. The Parcels are underlain by Cretaceous Mancos Shale mantled by Quaternary surficial deposits. These deposits include landslide, slump, debris-flow, earthflow, moraine, talus, colluvial, and glacial deposits. Solifluction, mass creep, slumps, landslides, and earthflows are mapped throughout the block. An inferred west-northwest striking fault cuts the Mancos Shale in the northern part of the block. Small tension fissures are mapped in the Mancos Shale along the northern and eastern part of the block (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment VV).

No mines or prospects are known in this area. Mineral resource potential for all locatable and leasable deposit types is low. There is moderate potential for sand and gravel deposits.

Parcel D: Brush Creek (Map 10; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle) See Parcel 11 and Parcel D, above.

January 27, 1998

Parcel D includes numerous small tracts of land on both sides of East River. In general, the tracts are underlain by Quaternary surficial deposits that overlie Cretaceous Mancos Shale. The Quaternary units include alluvial, alluvial fan, debris flow, landslide, slump-scarp, debris slope, earthflow, and moraine deposits (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment N). Slope stability could be the major concern here.
No mines or prospects are known in this area. Mineral resource potential for all locatable and leasable deposit types is low. There is high potential for sand and gravel deposits in the alluvial deposits in the East River valley.
Parcel E: South (Map 3; Gothic 1:24,000 quadrangle)
Parcel E, at the northwest end of the Crested Butte Laccolith is underlain by Mancos Shale that is mantled extensively by Quaternary deposits including debris slopes, and landslide, moraine, thinly mantled with glacial debris. Scarps, arcuate lobes, or ridges indicating mass movement are common in every map unit in the parcel (Gaskill and others, 1991; see attachment VV).
No mines or prospects are known on Parcel E. Mineral resource potential for all locatable and leasable deposit types is low. There is moderate potential for sand and gravel deposits.

Lower adit (at 11,500-ft elevation) and 1,700-ft crosscut tunnel to main 700-ft raise of the Sylvanite mine. No evidence of production from tunnel or lower 500 ft of raise. A 50-ft-wide fault zone of clay and calc-silicate hornfels cuts north-south across tunnel 300 ft from adit (sample here assayed 0.09 oz gold; Weisner and Bieniewski, 1984).
Main adit (at 12,125-ft elevation) to Sylvanite mine. Includes a 600-ft drift along Sylvanite No. 2 vein that intersects main shaft to upper and lower levels, and two westerly trending drifts (450 ft long and 300 ft long) that cut other veins.
About 2,200 ft of tunnels; 1,200 ft of vertical workings and extensively stoped areas along the Sylvanite and Sylvanite No. 2 veins. Nearvertical fissure veins along normal faults cut metas'edimentary rocks and underlying granodiorite. Veins contain native (wire) silver, ruby silver (proustite and pyrargylte), argentiferous tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, barite, massive sulfides, minor gold, and galena. General vein material grades from about 1 to 4 oz silver per ton with bonanza streaks. Estimated production between 100,000 and 300,000 oz of silver (Zahony, 1986b). Mineral specimens at Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colo., and Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
Prominent dumps and adits at about 12,000-ft elevation at head of westfacing basin. Wire silver. Do. Do.

Mr. M. M. Underwood, Jr. Director of Physical Resources U.S. Forest Service - Rocky Mountain Region P.O. Box 25127 Lakewood, CO 80225-0127

Dear Mr. Underwood:

This is in response to your March 24, 1998 (received March 26) request for information on locatable mineral resources in the land exchange proposal in which the County of El Paso, acting through its Parks Department and its Transportation Department, has offered certain non-Federal lands within the Pike National Forest in exchange for Federal lands also within the Pike National Forest.

In accordance with the working agreement under Public Law 86-509, we are providing you with a report on the locatable mineral resources on the lands described in Exhibits "A" and "B", included with your request. These lands comprise an unspecified number of acres, well in excess of 240, in El Paso County, Colorado.

Sincerely yours,

Anna B. Wilson, Geologist Mineral Resource Surveys, Central Region

i

NON-FEDERAL LANDS

Parcel A: Forest Lakes Parcel (Palmer Lake 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The Forest Lakes parcel is along the nearly north-striking Rampart Range Fault in Pleistocene Rocky Flats, Verdos, and Slocum alluvium and in Upper Holocene colluvium (Trimble and Machette, 1979). The parcel may include some Pikes Peak Grranite (Precambrian Y), especially to the west of the fault.

There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the Forest Lakes parcel (USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential is low.

Parcels B and C: Barr Trailhead Parcels (Manitou Springs 1:24,000 quadrangle)

The Barr Trailhead parcels are entirely within Pikes Peak Granite (Precambrian Y) immediately west of the Ute Pass Fault (Trimble and Machette, 1979; Scott and Wobus, 1973).

There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the Barr Trailhead parcels (USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential is low.

FEDERAL LANDS

Parcels A and B (Black Forest 1:24,000 quadrangle)

Parcels A and B are mapped entirely within the upper part of the Paleocene and Upper Cretaceous Dawson Formation which is composed of arkosic sandstone, siltstone, claystone, and minor conglomerate. Dawson Formation forms most of the bedrock between Colorado Springs and Penver and is as much as 610 m thick (Scott and Wobus, 1973).

There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the Barr Trailhead parcels (USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential is low.

LOCATABLE MINERAL REPORT FOR THE FOSSEY/PAUL LAND EXCHANGE OFFER,
ROOSEVELT NATIONAL FOREST, LARIMER COUNTY, COLORADO
By Anna B. Wilson U.S. Geological Survey
December 16, 1997

Property that Kenneth and Lynerte Fossey and Eldor and Phyllis Paul shall

consider exchanging:

T5N. R72W. Sixth Principal Meridian. Colorado Sec. 25, S 1/2 SW 1/4

77.75 acres

EXHIBIT "B":

Property that the Forest Service shall consider exchanging:

T5N. R72W. Sixth Principal Meridian, Colorado Sec. 25, N 1/2 SW 1/4 (and, if needed for equalization, a portion of Sec. 25, NW 1/4 SE 1/4)

80.00 acres

Total acreage considered for exchange

157.75 acres

SUMMARY: (Panorama Peak 24K, Greeley 250K)

The properties are contiguous and appear to be in Precambrian biotite gneiss, schist and migmatite principally derived from sedimentary rocks with the peak of metamorphism at about 1,750 Ma (Braddock and Cole, 1978; Tweto, 1979). Locally there may be interbedded hornblende gneiss, calc-silicate rock, quartz-rich rock, and metaconglomerate.

There are no mines in the immediate vicinity (U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, b). The Crystal Mountain pegmatite district is more than 10 miles to the north. Uranium minerals have been reported in the region but none in the Panorama Peak 7 1/2' quadrangle (Nelson-Moore and others, 1978). Reports of copper and gold at Drake, about 5 miles to the northeast, are unsubstantiated (Vanderwilt, 1947).

Mineral potential on the properties is expected to be low.

These are occasionally augmented with unpublished documents andpersonal experiences. No field studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only ifthey appear in the above documents.
NON-FEDERAL LANDS Petzite. La Clede and Occidental Lode Mining Claims (Gold Hill 1:24,000)
Three patented mining claims are located at the intersection of the Hoosier fault and the Caribou antiform in cordierite- and magnetite-bearing sillimanite-biotite gneiss and biotite-quartzplagioclase gneiss (Gable, 1980, map unit Xgns; see figure 1) that is intruded by 1,700 Ma Boulder Creek granodiorite (Gable, 1980, map unit Xgd).
The claims are more than 1.5 mi. northwest of the productive parts of the Gold Hill mining district. No mines are located in the immediate vicinity of the claims (Levering and Goddard, 1950; USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential of the claims is moderate.
T. 2 N.. R. 73 W.. Sec. 35. SW 1/4 NW 1/4 (Ward 1:24,000 quadrangle)
This property is entirely covered with Upper Pleistocene glacial till of Pinedale age and Holocene and Pleistocene organic-rich (peat bog) sediment (Gable and Madole, 1976, map units Qp and Qo, respectively; see figure 2).
A few miles to the north, peat has been removed commercially (Gable and Madole, 1976). With the exception of peat, no mineral deposits are known in the vicinity of the property. The till should be examined for suitability as a source of sand and gravel. Mineral resource potential for all other deposits is low.
Grand Island Mining District: Chilkoot Arapaho. and Klondvke Claims (Monarch Lake, East Portal, and Nederland 1:24,000 quadrangles)
These long strings of claims parallel a NW-striking shear zone in Boulder Creek Granodiorite (Gable, 1969, map unit gd, see figure 3B; Young, 1991, map unit Xb, see figure 3 A) and in biotite gneiss (Gable, 1969, map unit gnb, see figure 3B; Young, 1991, map unit Xgb, see figure 3A) on the northeast side of North Fork Middle Boulder Creek.
The property is associated with the 4th of July mine which produced 115 tons or ore containing an average of 1.6 oz/ton gold and 3 oz/ton silver from 1914-1937 (Pearson, 1980, p. 61-63). There are several other mines and prospects in the vicinity, none with recorded production. Pearson (1980) assumed the ore came from a small pocket and presented no evidence that larger deposits

C:\..Alocmin\locmin35.wpd

September 9, 1998

were likely to be present. Mineral resource potential for small base and precious metal veins is moderate.
FEDERAL LANDS T. 1 S.. R. 73 W.. Sec. 24. part of NE 1/4: Sec. 13. SW 1/4. SE 1/4 (Nederland 1:24,000 quadrangle)
These four properties are in Proterozoic Boulder Creek Granodiorite and two phases of biotite gneiss all of which are intruded by quartz monzonite (Gable, 1969, map units gd, gnb and gnbc, qm; see figure 4) and cut by a northwest-striking fault.
These tracts are in an unmineralized area about 1 mi. north of the Boulder County Tungsten District (Levering and Goddard, 1950). Mineral resource potential is low.

SUMMARY: (Red Feather Lakes 1:24,000, Fort Collins 1:100,000, and Greeley 1:250,000 quadrangles)
Detailed geologic mapping of the Red Feather Lakes area could not be located. Extrapolating from small-scale mapping (Braddock and Cole, 1978; Tweto, 1979) and from adjacent 7 1/2-minute quadrangle maps to the north (Braddock and others, 1989) and south (Shaver and others, 1988), it would appear that the Larimer County properties are underlain by 1.4 Ga Silver Plume Granite.
There are no mines in the immediate vicinity (U.S. Geological Survey, 1998a, b) yet there are small mining districts in the region. The nearest of these is the Manhattan district, about 5 miles to the southwest, which produced about 27 ounces of Au and 9 ounces of Ag from 1932-1941 (Vanderwilt, 1947, p. 139) probably from Tertiary veins in the Silver Plume granite and a small amount of placer gold. Uranium minerals have been reported in veins in the granite in the region but none closer than 5 mi. from the properties (Nelson-Moore and others, 1978).
Mineral resource potential for Au-Ag in Tertiary veins, on the properties is low. The properties should be examined for presence of uranium minerals in fractures in the granite and placer gold in any surficial deposits. Locally, Silver Plume Granite has been used for industrial commodities such as gravel and monument stones.

Note: As of 2/20/98, per Nancy Hollenkamp, the lands in Gunnison County have been withdrawn from this exchange.

There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the property (USGS, 1998a,b; Soulliere and others, 1996). Mineral resource potential of the Jolley Creek property is low.
FEDERAL LANDS Eleven Bar Ranch (Sullivan) Property (Slide Creek 1:24,000 and Craig 1:250,000 quadrangles)
The Eleven Bar Ranch (Sullivan) property is along Pine Creek in the Flat Tops. Cretaceous Mancos Shale (Tweto, 1976; see figure 2) covers the area.
A mineral resource assessment of Routt National Forest (Soulliere and others, 1996) did not evaluate this area as favorable for any metallic mineral resources. There are no known mineral deposits on the property (USGS, 1998a,b; Soulliere and others, 1996). Mineral resource potential is low.
There is moderate potential for oil in fractured shale, coal, and conventional and subthrust gas accumulations (Soulliere and others, 1996). At least two drill holes are adjacent to the property but the target of the holes is not known.

LOCATABLE MINERAL REPORT FOR THE JACK B. KELLEY ENTERPRIZES FISH CREEK LAND EXCHANGE OFFER,
SAN JUAN AND UNCOMPAHGRE NATIONAL FORESTS, DOLORES, MONTEZUMA, SAN JUAN, AND SAN MIGUEL COUNTIES, COLORADO
Thefollowing report is based on information contained in USGS mineral resource and commodityfiles, mineral information databases (MRDS and MAS), and on reports and maps available in the USGS library. These are occasionally augmented with unpublished documents andpersonal experiences. No field studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only ifthey appear in the above documents.
FEDERAL LANDS
Parcels A-D (Dove Creek 100K and Clyde Lake 24K quadrangles)
The area of the parcels is in gently southwest-dipping Mesozoic and upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks which host natural gas, carbon dioxide, coal, uranium-vanadium, and limestone deposits elsewhere in the region (Neubert and others, 1992). All four parcels are in Permian through Jurassic strata exposed by the down-cutting of Fish Creek, a tributary of the Dolores River. Quaternary alluvium fills the creek bottom (Haynes and others, 1972). Besides the alluvium, rock units include arkosic sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate of the Permian Cutler Formation, red fluvial siltstone, sandstone, and shale of the Triassic Dolores Formation, and cross-bedded sandstone, limey sandstone, and limestone of the Jurassic Junction Creek Sandstone, Wanakah Formation, and Entrada Sandstone, undifferentiated (Cross and Ransome, 1905; Haynes and others, 1972; Van Loenen and others, 1997; see attachment A).
No mines, prospects, or occurrences are known in this area (Van Loenen and others, 1997; USGS, 1997 a, b). The Fish Creek parcels are located well west of the mining and exploration activity at Rico and well east of the area prospected for uranium and vanadium and has not been assigned mineral potential for locatable or leasable minerals (Van Loenen and others, 1997). There may be a sand and gravel resource in the alluvium in Fish Creek (Van Loenen and others, 1997).
NON-FEDERAL LANDS
House Creek tract (Dove Creek 100K, Yellow Jacket 62.5K, and Trimble Point 24K quadrangles)
This tract, termed House Creek for this report, is northwest of the northeast-trending House Creek Fault which is dropped down to the northwest (Hackman, 1959; Haynes and others, 1972; Van Loenen and others, 1997). Rock units are mapped as Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and Burro Canyon Formation, undifferentiated, and overlain by Mancos Shale (Hackman, 1959; Van Loenen and others, 1997).
This region is known more for its wealth of Native American artifacts and recreation potential adjacent to McPhee Reservoir than for any mineral potential. No mines, prospects, or occurrences are known in this area and it is not in a region with potential for locatable minerals (Van Loenen and others, 1997; U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, b).

The area is within a much larger region assigned favorable potential for leasable oil and gas accumulations in the Carbonate Buildup Play where there are conventional oil and gas accumulations in porous carbonate mounds in equivalents of the Hermosa Group on the eastern margin of the Paradox Basin (Van Loenen and others, 1997).
The tract is also in an area outlined as favorable for salable commodities including dimension stone and aggregates (Van Loenen and others, 1997). The tract should be examined to determine if, on a sitespecific scale, there is potential for these commodities.
Beauty of the West and Thunder Shower (Silverton 100K and Ophir 24K quadrangles)
Unless otherwise cited, the geologic descriptions on which this assessment is based are from newly available mapping (Luedke, 1996; see attachment B). Bedrock is upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic, mainly clastic, sedimentary rocks that dip west to southwest. These rocks are unconformably overlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks that are flat lying to gently eastward-dipping. This volcanic assemblage is predominantly volcaniclastic rocks of intermediate composition in the lower part and welded ash-flow tuff of silicic composition in the upper part. Middle to late(?) Tertiary igneous dikes, sills, and small bodies of intermediate composition intruded the bedded rocks. Two large stocks, the Ophir (northwest of the tracts) and Grizzly Peak (southwest of the tracts) were emplaced about 26 Ma. Contact metamorphism extends about several hundred meters from these stocks but isn't prominent near the small intrusions. During Pleistocene the region was extensively glaciated: the resulting alpine topography is locally covered with a variety of surficial deposits (Luedke, 1996).
In the northern part of Ophir quadrangle, faults are oriented E-W, are long, pronounced, and mineralized. In the central and southern part of the quadrangle, including the Ice Lake Basin area (where the tracts considered for exchange are located), faults are generally NE- and NW- trending, short, and only minimally mineralized (Luedke, 1996).
At small scale (1:250,000), the general area including the Ice Lake Basin area is identified as favorable for the occurrence of two types of deposits: polymetallic replacement and skarn deposits and Creede-type epithermal veins in Tertiary volcanic terrane (Van Loenen and others, 1997). In the San Juan National Forest, the quantitative implication of a favorable designation means only that a 50 acre parcel of land so designated, would have between a 1 in 5,000 and a 1 in 10,000 chance for the occurrence of either a polymetallic replacement or epithermal (Creede-type) vein deposit (G.T. Spanski, U.S. Geological Survey, written communication 2/12/97).
On a site-specific scale, the geology within these tracts differs considerably from the regional generalizations on which the favorable designation is based. Primarily, these tracts are not in carbonate terrane, are quite distant from porphyry deposits, and are south of the area of intense mineralization. Little is known about any of the mining activity, past or present, in this district. Neither of these claims appear in the MRDS or MAS databases. Considerable local exploration work in the Ice Lake Basin area in the 1960's yielded no significant discoveries (R.G. Luedke, U.S. Geological Survey, retired, verbal communication 2/5/97)~nor did prospectors find much in the previous 80 years or so. Intermittent, smallscale exploration for veins of Au, Ag, (Cu, Pb, Zn) is likely to continue in the Ice Lake Basin area (Neubert and others, 1992).
Mineral potential on these claims is expected to be moderate. It is unlikely that any deposit in this district would be economically viable in the foreseeable future. There could be potential for acidic, sulfide-rich,

drainage from mines in this area: any existing mine dumps and effluent should be examined for potential metal-mine drainage hazards.
Beauty of the West follows northeast-trending veins in the Burns Member of the Oligocene Silverton Volcanics and underlying San Juan Formation (see attachment B). These are intruded by a small mass of-26 Ma granodiorite. Both the intrusive and extrusive rocks are hydrothermally altered predominantly to quartz-sericite-clay. The northeastern end of the claim is buried under a rock glacier, the southwestern end is covered with talus. An early map (Cross and Purington, 1899) shows a gold quartz vein in this vicinity. Gold concentrations in samples taken from known mineralized veins and abandoned mine dumps in the vicinity are anomalous but subeconomic (Neubert and others, 1992). The claim map from 1883 shows a shaft and tunnel in San Juan County and the discovery cut and a tunnel in San Miguel County.
Thunder Shower follows a vein in the Burns Member of the Silverton Volcanics (see attachment B). Hydrothermal alteration is prominent at the northern end of the claim. There is no indication from the available literature of mineralization on this claim. The claim map from 1883 shows two north-trending tunnels near the center of the claim.
Tin Horn and Woods (Silverton 100K and Silverton 24K quadrangles)
"A northwest-trending calcite-cemented breccia zone with some quartz veining is exposed at caved workings in Putnam Basin" and continues for about a mile to the southeast (Neubert and others, 1992, p. 203). A select sample of limonite- and manganese-oxide-stained quartz vein material at the southeast end, at or close to the claim in question, yielded 0.765 opt gold and minor amounts of other metallic elements (Neubert and others, 1992, p. 203, table 21, appendices A, B, C; see attachment C)).
As extrapolated from two maps (Steven and others, 1974; Luedke, 1996) the parcel is underlain by Permian Cutler Formation overlain by Eocene Telluride Conglomerate and Oligocene San Juan Formations.
No mention is made of these claims in the literature or databases. The claims are at the periphery of the area designated as favorable for polymetallic replacement veins and skarns and Creede-type epithermal replacement deposits. Mineral potential is expected to be moderate.

Capitol. Diamond Pillow. Grandview. Mayflower, Mammoth, O.K., Pride of the West, Round Up. Silver Crown and Hidden Treasure and Mountain Queen (Silverton 100K and Ophir 24K quadrangles)
WARNING: This location is in question. The block is on the northwest end of Rolling Mtn straddling the San Juan/San Miguel county line on the BLM land status maps (attachment D) and county claim plats. According to BLM Master Title Plats (attachment £) it is on the east end of Rolling Mountain. For this assessment, I have assumed the former is the correct location.
This claim block is in an area of Oligocene granodiorite of the Grizzly Peak stock and is cut by veins or mineralized fissures (Luedke, 1996; see attachment F). The northern part of the block is hydrothermally altered to quartz-sericite-clay type that is commonly associated with ore deposits or with structural features related to ore localization (Luedke, 1996). Locally includes quartz-clay acid-sulfate type alteration. Overlying Holocene talus and Pleistocene glacial drift obscure the granodiorite (Luedke, 1996).
The area was not included in favorable terrane for any locatable mineral deposits (Van Loenen and others, 1997). Mineral potential is expected to be low to moderate.
Vermillion and Black Bear: (Silverton 100K and Ophir 24K quadrangles)
WARNING: This location is in question. The claims are in San Miguel County according to the County claim plats, on the west end of Rolling Mtn straddling the San Juan/San Miguel county line on the BLM land status maps (attachment D), or on the east end of Rolling Mountain immediately south of the Big Three Mine (USGS Ophir 7 1/2 topo) according to aligning the county lines and Hope Lake on the BLM Master Title Plats (attachment E) with the USGS 7 1/2 topo (Master Title plat scale of 30 chains/inch = 1:23,720 so alignment is pretty good). For this assessment, I have assumed the first is the correct location.
The location of these two claims is unclear. However, if they are in San Miguel County the geology as mapped (Luedke, 1996) is almost identical to that of the Capitol claim block.
If the location on the Master Title Plat is correct, these claims are primarily in fresh Oligocene granodiorite of the Grizzly Peak stock immediately south of the Big Three mine (Luedke, 1996; see attachments F and G). Portions may be concealed by Pleistocene glacial drift and Holocene talus.
At the Big Three mine, there are north-trending, steeply dipping shears and veins in partially bleached and clay altered Grizzly Peak monzonite stock and all samples contained at least 600 ppb (0.018 oz/ton) gold and 60 ppm (1.8 oz/ton) silver (Neubert and others, 1992, p. 196). However, south of the mine, ore grades are lower, and alteration and veins are not mapped.
On the Black Bear and Vermillion claims as assumed to be located about 1 mile to the northwest of the Big Three mine, mineral potential for polymetallic vein deposits is expected to be low to moderate.

Silver Star (Silverton 100K and Ophir 24K quadrangles)

This claim block is in an area of relatively fresh Oligocene granodiorite of the Grizzly Peak stock. Veins and mineralized fissures are shown in the area, though perhaps not on this claim (Luedke, 1996; see attachment F).

The area was not included in favorable terrane for any locatable mineral deposits (Van Loenen and others, 1997). Mineral potential is expected to be low.

SUMMARY:

Parcels A-D: No mines, prospects, or occurrences are known in this area (Van Loenen and others, 1997; USGS, 1997 a, b). The Fish Creek parcels were not designated favorable for locatable or leasable minerals (Van Loenen and others, 1997). There may be a sand and gravel resource in the alluvium in Fish Creek (Van Loenen and others, 1997).

House Creek tract: No mines, prospects, or occurrences are known in this area and it is not in a region with potential for locatable minerals (Van Loenen and others, 1997; U.S. Geological Survey, 1997a, b).

The tract is within a much larger region assigned favorable potential for leasable oil and gas accumulations in the Carbonate Buildup Play where there are conventional oil and gas accumulations in porous carbonate mounds in equivalents of the Hermosa Group on the eastern margin of the Paradox Basin (Van Loenen and others, 1997).

The tract is also in an area outlined as favorable for salable commodities including dimension stone and aggregates (Van Loenen and others, 1997). The tract should be examined to determine if, on a sitespecific scale, there is potential for these commodities.

Lode Claims:

All of the claims are within an area outlined as favorable for oil and gas accumulations of the Silverton Delta Play in which conventional accumulations may occur in permeable deltaic sandstones or equivalents of the Hermosa Group along the flank of the Paradox Basin (Van Loenen and others, 1997).

All but Tin Horn, Woods, and Silver Star may be in, or close to, areas assigned favorable potential for dimension stone and large aggregate from Tertiary and Late Cretaceous intrusive rocks (Van Loenen and others, 1997).

Mineral potential for locatable resources is assigned as follows:

Beauty of the West and Thunder Shower, in Ice Lake Basin area occur in an area designated favorable for polymetallic replacement and skarn, and epithermal vein (Creede- type) deposits (Van Loenen and others, 1997). Mineral potential is expected to be moderate.

Tin Horn and Woods are on the periphery of the favorable area. If the mineralized vein in Putnam Basin continues southeast to these claims, mineral potential would be moderate.

Capitol...Mountain Queen block was not included in favorable terrane for any locatable mineral deposits (Van Loenen and others, 1997). This is somewhat unusual in that at the time of patent (1890) the claims

C:\..Alocmin\locmin24.wpd

160

December 17, 1997

must have been proven to be economically viable. Although outside the favorable area, these could have as much as moderate potential for polymetallic vein deposits.
Vermillion and Black Bear: Mineral potential could be as much as moderate if alteration and veins continue north of the ridge into San Miguel County, otherwise low.
Silver Star was not included in favorable terrane for any locatable mineral deposits (Van Loenen and others, 1997). Mineral potential is expected to be low.

Mr. M.M. Underwood, Jr. Director of Physical Resources U.S. Forest Service - Rocky Mountain Region P.O. Box 25127 Lakewood, CO 80225-0127
Dear Mr. Underwood:

These data are occasionally augmented with other unpublished documents, personal communications, andprofessional experiences. Nofield studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only ifthey appear in the above documents.

Non-Federal: South Dakota Department of Transportation Mount Rushmore 1:24,000 quadrangle

This tract is in quartz schist, quartz-mica schist, and quartz-mica-staurolite schist (Norton, 1976; see attachment A) that corresponds with Early Proterozoic graywacke (DeWitt and others, 1989).

The tract is at a complex intersection and overlapping of several metallic mineralized districts (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see attachment B). The area is well within the Hugo district which contains the nearby Hugo and Monte Carlo mines (DeWitt and others, 1988b; see attachment C), and hosts potassium feldspar and mica pegmatites. The Etta district which contains Be- and Libearing pegmatites overlaps the eastern part of the tract. The tract is also at the eastern periphery of the Mount Rushmore district which hosts mica-bearing pegmatites and the western edge of the Keystone and Holy Terror districts which host Early Proterozoic syngenetic Au and Au-Ag vein deposits (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995).

At an assessment scale of 1:250,000, DeWitt and others (1986) assigned this area high mineral resource potential for small- to medium-size pegmatite deposits containing all pegmatite commodities except tin (Sn). On a site-specific scale, and based on lack of prospects and pegmatites at 1:24,000 scale geologic mapping (Norton, 1976), the potential is low to moderate.

Federal Property Hill City 1:24,000 quadrangle

Geology of this area (Hill City 7 1/2-minute quadrangle) was mapped and described by Ratte and Wayland (1969). Early Proterozoic pegmatitic Harney Peak Granite forms a dome intruding folded pelitic phyllites and schists, and meagraywackes (DeWitt and others, 1989). The Federal property is north of the dome in Bugtown Formation composed of staurolite-grade quartz phyllite interlayered with thick-bedded quartzose rocks (Ratte and Wayland, 1969; see attachment D). Quaternary alluvium and terrace gravels surround the tract on the south and east margins.

An adit with a dump and a prospect are mapped on the property (Ratte and Wayland, 1969; DeWitt and others, 1988a). The tract is within 1 mi. of five mines and numerous other claims and prospects (DeWitt and others, 1988a; see attachment E). The J.R., J.R. Extension, and Eldorado mines are Early Proterozoic vein deposits. Typical commodities expected would be Au, Ag, and minor Pb, As, and Cu. The Carnbray mine is an Early Proterozoic Sn- and W-bearing pegmatite. The Hidden Treasure mine is a potassium feldspar-bearing pegmatite. Three mineralized districts overlap the tract including the Three Forks, Hill City, and Spring Creek districts (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see attachment B).

February 26, 1998

All of the above named deposits are within thick-bedded metagraywacke locally interlayered with thin layers of phyllite and schist and not within the same subunit of Bugtown Formation that is mapped in the tract (Ratte and Wayland, 1969; see attachment E). The tract is included in larger areas that were assigned moderate mineral resource potential for small vein deposits of Au and Ag and for small to medium Sn and Li pegmatites (DeWitt and others, 1986, pi. 2, fig. 17, p. 64-65) at an assessment scale of 1:250,000. Mapping at 1:24,000 (Ratte and Wayland, 1969) indicates no pegmatite nor the "correct" unit of the Bugtown Formation. Thus, on a site-specific scale, mineral resource potential for deposits of potassium feldspar or Sn- and Li- or W- bearing pegmatite, or Au-Ag veins is low to moderate.

Non-Federal: The Nature Conservancy Jewel Cave (NE), Fourmile, Custer, and Jewel Cave NW 1:24,000 quadrangles
HES 369. 406. 457. 528. 351. 353. 405. 474. 55 (Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
These tracts are entirely within areas mapped as Lower Permian and Pennsylvanian Minnelusa Formation (DeWitt and others, 1989). In this region, the Minnelusa Formation is composed of sandstone, solution breccia (anhydrite in subsurface), limestone, and shale; slight uranium enrichment may occur in the basal part (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tracts are a few miles west of the mineralized part of the Black Hills (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18), but the area was not deemed to be favorable for any locatable mineral commodities at an assessment scale of 1:250,000 (DeWitt and others, 1986, pi. 2) .
There is low potential for small to medium oil and gas accumulations beneath the tracts. These may have formed about 100-400 Ma in marine environments where organic remains were modified into kerogen and petroleum-related substances (DeWitt and others, 1986, pi. 3).
HES 345 (Fig. 3)
The geology of the tract and easement are mapped at 1:250,000 scale primarily as Early Proterozoic metagraywacke with some metaconglomerate and iron-formation in the southern part (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The lands are in an area with a number of unidentified prospect pits and within a half mile of several small pegmatite deposits (DeWitt and others, 1988a; see fig. 14).
The tract is located in the southwestern part of the Harney Peak metallic mineral district which is known to host Early Proterozoic mica and potassium feldspar-bearing pegmatite deposits (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).
At 1:250,000 scale, the area is included in areas assigned high mineral resource potential for various commodities found in pegmatite deposits (DeWitt and others, 1986). Abundant small prospects and mines are in the area but the lack of them on this particular tract would suggest that pegmatite is not exposed near the surface and that the mineral resource potential would be low to moderate.

Federal Property Hayward, Custer, Fourmile, Cicero Peak, Pringle, and Jewel Cave SE 1:24,000 quadrangles
Area 1 (Fig. 7)
At 1:250,000 scale, Area 1 is mapped as Lower Mississippian Pahasapa Limestone and Lower Mississippian to Upper Devonian Englewood Formation (DeWitt and others, 1989). Both of these units are dolomitic limestones: the Pahasapa is gray to light-tan, cavernous, and cliffforming, the Englewood is pink to light-gray (DeWitt and others, 1989).
Area 1 is east of the Hugo pegmatite district, west of the Battle Creek placer district, and outside of any outlined metallic mineral districts (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995). Three unnamed Tertiary and Holocene stream placer deposits are located about a mile to the northeast (DeWitt and others, 1988b; see fig. 15) in the Battle Creek district (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995).
At 1:250,000 mineral resource assessment, the area was assigned moderate potential for highcalcium limestone (DeWitt and others, 1986).
Area 2 (Fig. 8)
At 1:250,000 scale, Area 2 is mapped as Early Proterozoic metagraywacke (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The parcel is located between Old Mike (Great Northern), Phelps (Roosevelt), and Poppy (claim #18) deposits (DeWitt and others, 1988a; see fig 14), but in an area not assigned to any metallic mineral district (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).
At 1:250,000, the area was assigned high potential for small to medium size deposits containing most pegmatite commodities except for tin (Sn) and mica (DeWitt and others, 1986). At 1:100,000, Area 2 is not included in any metallic mineral districts (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18) and thus would have low potential for these commodities.
Area 3 (Fig. 9)
At 1:25 0,000 scale, Area 3 is mapped as the middle part of the Early Proterozoic metagraywacke unit (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tract is close to numerous small pegmatite deposits including the Surprise Mica, Lame Deer, Knowles Lode, Big Horn Lode, Tin Key, and Victory (DeWitt and others, 1988a; see fig. 14). One prospect pit is located in the northwest part of Area 3 (lot 12). Area 3 is partly in the Harney Peak, Custer, and Calamity Peak metallic mineral districts (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).

C:\..Alocmin\locmin28.wpd

185

May 1, 1998

At 1:250,000 the mineral resource potential for pegmatite commodities (except tin and mica) was expected to be high (DeWitt and others, 1986). On a site-specific scale, the mineral resource potential for pegmatite deposits is moderate.
Area 4 (Fig. 9)
Area 4 is located along the southern boundary of the Custer town-site. It is mapped at 1:250,000 as being in the lower part of the Early Proterozoic metagraywacke unit (DeWitt and others, 1989). The graywacke is not necessarily the same graywacke as that which underlies Area 3, due to an intervening fault (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tract is close to the Aladdin pegmatite deposit (DeWitt and others, 1988a; see fig. 14) and is in an area where the Calamity Peak and Custer metallic mineral districts overlap (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).
At 1:250,000 scale, there is high potential for small to medium pegmatite commodities and their common commodities except Sn (DeWitt and others, 1986). On a site-specific scale, the mineral resource potential for pegmatite deposits is moderate.
Area 5 (Tig. 10)
Area 5 is mapped as Early Proterozoic upper metagraywacke (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tract includes the MacArthur (see fig. 16) and is immediately east of the Short Lode, Ray Prospect and Red Bird (Consolidated) Lode (DeWitt and others, 1988c). It is immediately west of the White Cloud, Ray, Roadside, and Jack Rabbit deposits (DeWitt and others, 1988d). Area 5 is within the Custer and Cicero Peak metallic mineral districts; expected commodities would be mica and potassium feldspar (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).
At 1:25 0,000 scale, there is high potential for small to medium pegmatite deposits and their common commodities except Sn (DeWitt and others, 1986). On a site-specific scale, the mineral resource potential for pegmatite deposits is also high.
Area 6 (Fig. 11)
Area 6 is mapped as Early Proterozoic upper metaraywacke (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tract is adjacent to the Soda Spar, Lucky Twist (Sutherland), Red Bird (McClaren), and Blue Bird deposits (DeWitt and others, 1998d; see fig. 16) and is within the Custer metallic mineral district where mica and potassium feldspar are the expected commodities (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18).

May 1, 1998

At 1:250,000 scale, there is high potential for small to medium pegmatite deposits and their common commodities except Sn (DeWitt and others, 1986). On a site-specific scale, the mineral resource potential for pegmatite deposits is also high.
Area? (Fig. 12)
Area 7 is mapped mostly as Early Proterozoic upper metagraywacke possibly with some Upper Ordovician Whitewood Dolomite, Middle Ordovician Winnipeg Formation, and Lower Ordovician to Upper Cambrian Deadwood Formation, undivided (DeWitt and others, 1989).
The tract contains a quarry immediately northwest of Pringle townsite (DeWitt and others, 1988d, see fig. 17; Wilson and DeWitt, 1995, #896) where high purity silica sand was produced from a Cambrian paleoplacer in the basal part of the Deadwood Formation. This industrial commodity, known as "cracking sand", is valued for its consistent grain size and sphericity for use in drilling muds (Ed DeWitt, written communication, April 1998).
Area 7 is within three overlapping metallic mineral districts: Custer (feldspar and mica), Pringle (Li, Be, and feldspar), and Shirttail (Si) (Wilson and DeWitt, 1995; see fig. 18). At an assessment scale of 1:250,000, it was assigned high potential for non Sn-bearing pegmatites and moderate potential for medium sized, high-calcium limestone deposits (DeWitt and others, 1986). On a site-specific scale, the tract has moderate mineral resource potential for pegmatite deposits. Elsewhere in the Black Hills, high-calcium limestone is an important product of the Minnekahta and Pahasapa Limestones and to a much lesser extent the Whitewood Dolomite and Englewood Formation (DeWitt and others, 1986, p. 85). Only the Whitewood Dolomite, which has high magnesium content, may be present in Area 7. Therefore, the resource potential for high-calcium limestone is low.
Area 8 (Fig. 13)
Area 8 is mapped entirely within Lower Permian Minnekahta Limestone (Redden and others, in press).
At a mineral resource assessment scale of 1:250,000, the tract was assigned moderate potential for medium sized oil and gas accumulations (DeWitt and others, 1986, pi. 3) and high potential for large bedded deposits of high-calcium limestone. The region immediately to the southwest was assigned high potential for medium-sized bedded gypsum deposits.
Based on mapping by Redden and others (in press), this tract has high mineral resource potential for high-calcium limestone and for high purity limestone for use in cement. Minnekahta Limestone is commonly used as road aggregate (Ed DeWitt, oral communication, May 1, 1998).

NON-FEDERAL AND FEDERAL LANDS
DeJong and Buffalo Gap National Grassland Parcels (Cottonwood SE 1:24,000, Kadoka 1:100,000, and Martin 1:250,000 quadrangles)
The geology of all of the parcels considered for exchange are mapped at 1:500,000 scale as being within Oligocene White River Group (includes Brule and Chadron Formations) which unconformably overlies Cretaceous Pierre Formation, undifferentiated (Darton, 1951, see attachment A; Petsch, 1953, see attachment B). Mapping at 1:250,000 scale (Sawyer and Martin, 1998) indicates that most of the parcels are in the White River Group, the easternmost of the parcels near Martin Dam may be underlain by Pierre Shale. Only the lone parcel southeast of Chamberlain Pass appears to be mostly in Quaternary terrace gravels overlying Pierre Shale.
Elsewhere in the Great Plains region the White River Group is known to contain bentonite and certain ash layers may locally contain zeolites. Mammalian fossils may also be found in parts of the White River Group.
There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the parcels (USGS, 1998a,b; J.F. Sawyer, South Dakota Geological Survey, personal communication, April 1998). Mineral resource potential on the Martin Dam parcels is low. Potential for sand and gravel deposits on the easternmost tract could be as much as moderate. To the best of my knowledge, the underlying formations have not been tested for oil and gas.

The following report is based on information contained in USGS mineral resource and commodityfiles, mineral information databases (MRDS and MAS), and on reports and maps available in the USGS library. These are occasionally augmented with unpublished documents andpersonal experiences. No field studies or on-site visits were performed in preparing this report. Emphasis is primarily on locatable mineral resources. Leasable and salable resources are covered only ifthey appear in the above documents.

NON-FEDERAL LANDS (School Section Mountain 1:24,000, Laramie Peak 1:100,000, and Torrington 1:250,000 quadrangles)

T.A. Bragg's parcel is along a nearly north-trending section of Curtis Gulch, east of Downey Park. An established trail runs along the west side of the gulch.

Although a considerable portion of the Laramie Range has been mapped in detail (Snyder, 1984, 1992, 1993; Snyder and others, 1995; Houston and Karlstom, 1992), detailed geologic mapping of the area covering the parcel could not be located. At 1:500,000 scale, the parcel is shown in the core of the Laramie Range in Archean 2,600 Ma granite, amphibolite, and minor metasedimentary rocks (Love and Christiansen, 1985; Spencer, 1916). These are cut by Proterozoic and Late Archean mafic intrusive dikes (Love and Christiansen, 1985).

Several mines and mining districts surround the parcel. The closest of these, "prospects north of Fortymile Ranch", part of the War Bonnet (Warbonnet) district, were prospected for copper (Spencer, 1916; Hausel, 1989; see fig. 1). More than 6 miles to the west of the parcel at least two mines associated with diabase dikes produced copper with small amounts of gold and silver. There is no mention of quantity of production (Hausel, 1989). At 1:500,000 scale mapping, the geology of these deposits appears to be identical to that in the parcel.

There are no known mineral deposits on the T.A. Bragg parcel (USGS, 1998a,b). Mineral resource potential is low.

FEDERAL LANDS (Albany and Lake Owen 1:24,000, Saratoga 1:100,000, Rawlins 1:250,000 quadrangles)

The federal land is about 2 mi. north of Albany and about 30 mi southwest of Laramie. It straddles Precambrian granite and the west flank of a syncline of Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous rocks in Centennial Valley (Houston and Orback, 1976). Much of the parcel is overlain by Quaternary sediments (fig. 2). Detailed geologic maps of the western part of the tract could not be located.

The basement rocks are separated by a northwest-striking, southwest-dipping, thrust fault. Sherman Granite (Precambrian Y) is exposed southwest of the fault. Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are presumed to be buried northeast of the fault (Houston and Orback, 1976). Quaternary and Tertiary (undivided) pediment gravels and colluvium, conglomerates and

C:\..Alocmin\locmin33.wpd

223

September 2, 1998

conglomeratic sandstones, Browns Park(?) or North Park(?) Formation, and White River Formation (Houston and Orback, 1976) overlie most of the tract. Quaternary alluvium is locally present in the stream valleys. (Houston and Orback, 1976).
There are no known mineral deposits in the vicinity of the parcel (USGS, 1998a,b; Houston and Orback, 1976). There is a report of chalcopyrite in sheared epidote-rich Sherman Granite 5-6 mi to the southeast. Niobrara Formation (Cretaceous), may contain argillaceous limestone that could be used in portland cement (Houston and Orback, 1976), but it is uncertain that any occurs in the tract. Calcareous sedimentary rocks near the base of the undivided Quaternary/Tertiary sedimentary rocks could be a potential source for pozzolan cement (Houston and Orback, 1976). Mineral resource potential of this tract is low.
