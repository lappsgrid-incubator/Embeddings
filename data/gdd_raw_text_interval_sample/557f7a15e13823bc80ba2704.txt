GEOLOGY AND GROUND-WATER RESOURCES OF GOSHEN COUNTY, WYOMING
By J. E. EAPP, F. N. VISHEK, and E. T. LITTLETON
ABSTBACT
Goshen County, which has an area of 2,186 square miles, lies in southeastern Wyoming. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ground-water resources of the county by determining the character, thickness, and extent of the waterbearing materials; the source, occurrence, movement, quantity, and quality of the ground water; and the possibility of developing additional ground water.
The rocks exposed in the area are sedimentary and range in age from Precambrian to Recent. A map that shows the areas of outcrop and a generalized section that summarizes the age, thickness, physical character, and water supply of these formations are included in the report. Owing to the great depths at which they lie beneath most of the county, the formations older than the Lance formation of Late Cretaceous age are not discussed in detail.
The Lance formation, of Late Cretaceous age, which consists mainly of beds of fine-grained sandstone and shale, has a maximum thickness of about 1,400 feet. It yields water, which usually is under artesian pressure, to a large number of domestic and stock wells in the south-central part of the county.
Tertiary rocks in the area include the Chadron and Brule formations of Oligocene age, the Arikaree formation of Miocene age, and channel deposits of Pliocene age. The Chadron formation is made up of two distinct units: a lower unit of highly variegated fiuviatile deposits that has been found only in the report area; and an upper unit that is typical of the formation as it occurs in adjacent areas. The lower unit, which ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 95 feet, is not known to yield water to wells, but its coarse-grained channel deposits probably would yield small quantities of water to wells. The upper unit, which ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 150 feet, yields sufficient quantities of water for domestic and stock uses from channel deposits of sandstone tinder artesian pressure. The Brule formation, which is mainly a siltstone, ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 450 feet and yields water to domestic and stock wells from fractures and from lenses of sandstone. The Arikaree formation ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 1,000 feet, and yields water to several domestic and stock wells in the northwestern part of the area. The Pliocene channel deposits, which probably do not exceed 25 feet in thickness, are not a source of water for wells in Goshen County.
The upland deposits, which are mainly of Pleistocene age, generally are dry and do not serve as aquifers; however, test drilling revealed several deep, buried channels occupied by deposits which probably would yield moderate quantities of water to wells if a sufficient saturated thickness were penetrated. The deposits of the third terrace, which are of Pleistocene age, range in thickness from a knife edge to about 210 feet and yield water to a large number of irrigation wells in the area. The flood-plain deposits, which are of Pleistocene and Recent age, range in thickness from a knife edge to about 200 feet. Those in

2 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
the valley of the North Platte River yield abundant water to many large supply wells. The flood-plain deposits along the valley of Rawhide Creek consist mainly of fine-grained materials and yield large supplies of water to wells only in the lower stretches of the creek valley near its confluence with the valley of the North Platte River. The deposits along the valleys of Horse and Bear Creeks generally are relatively thin and fine grained. In the vicinity of Lagrange, however, the deposits, which are about 45 feet thick, yield moderate supplies of water to several irrigation wells. Other Recent deposits in the area dune sand, loesslike deposits, and slope wash generally are fine grained and relatively thin and, hence, are not important sources of ground water.
The unconsolidated sand and gravel of the flood-plain and terrace deposits are the principal aquifers in the area. In some places they are in contact and form a single aquifer; in others they are separated and form distinct aquifers. However, generally they constitute a single aquifer and are so discussed. In most places in the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River wells yielding 1,000 to 3,000 gpm (gallons per minute) could be developed. Wells having yields of 500 to 1,500 gpm probably could be developed in most of the terrace deposits. In the valley fill along Horse and Bear Creeks near Lagrange, wells having yields of 500 to 1,000 gpm could be developed. However, in the valley fill along Rawhide Creek and along Horse and Bear Creeks, in the deposits of the third terrace, and in the flood-plain deposits along the North Platte River at places where the saturated thickness is less than 50 feet, the installation of large-capacity wells should be preceded by test drilling to determine the characteristics of the waterbearing materials. In favorable areas, wells with possible yields of 500 to 1,000 gpm could be developed in the Arikaree formation.
The specific capacity of wells in the unconsolidated sand and gravel of the flood-plain and terrace deposits of the North Platte River valley ranges from 21 to 250 gpm per foot of drawdown and averages 120 gpm per foot of drawdown. The wide range in specific capacity is due, in part, to the differences in the characteristics of the aquifers and, in part, to differences in the construction and development of the wells. Two irrigation wells in the valley fill along Horse and Bear Creeks in the vicinity of Lagrange have specific capacities of 16.6 and 40 gpm per foot of drawdown, respectively. In the same vicinity an irrigation well that produces water both from the alluvium and from fractures in the Brule formation has a specific capacity of 25 gpm per foot of drawdown. Wells in the bedrock formation generally could be expected to have much lower specific capacities than those in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits. A well that produces water from the Arikaree formation has a specific capacity of 12 gpm per foot of drawdown, and two wells that are in the Lance formation have specific capacities of 0.2 and 1.5 gpm per foot of drawdown.
The unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits of the valley fill of the North Platte River are highly permeable and transmit water readily to wells. Pumping tests indicate that the coefficients of permeability range from 1,500 to 8,700 gpd (gallons per day) per square foot for the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River, and from 2,300 to 5,900 gpd per square foot for the deposits of the third terrace. The storage coefficient was determined to be 0.235 for the flood-plain deposits and 0.216 for the deposits of the third terrace.
The depth to water in the alluvium along the streams generally is less than 50 feet, and in the terrace deposits it generally is less than 80 feet. In the bottom land along the major streams, and in much of the irrigated land south of the North Platte River, the water table is so near the surface that the capillary fringe extends to the root zone of the vegetation or to the land surface. In these areas much ground water is discharged by evapotranspiration. The depths t» water in the upland areas generally are between 200 and 300 feet

INTRODUCTION

Recharge to the ground-water reservoir in the nonirrigated part of Goshen Oounty is mainly by seepage from precipitation. The average annual precipitation in the area is about 14 inches, of which possibly not more than 5 percent percolates to the ground-water reservoir. In the irrigated area along the valleys of Horse and Bear Creeks it is estimated that half of the water diverted for irrigation is recharged to the ground-water reservoir. In the North Platte project area recharge to the water table in the area is from seepage from canals and irrigated land, from precipitation, and from underflow entering the area. It is estimated that about 202,000 acre-feet of water is recharged to the water table each year from the canals and irrigated fields, and about 6,000 acre-feet is recharged by underflow into the area through the alluvial fill. Recharge from precipitation and by underflow into the area through the bedrock formations totals about 97,000 acre-feet annually for the 4 years studied (water years 1947-48 to 1950-51), but no attempt was made to determine the portion contributed by each process.
Most of the recoverable ground water in the area is stored in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits of the valley fill. Practically all the ground water available for irrigation, industrial, and municipal supplies occurs in these deposits. The approximate quantity of ground water in storage in the valley fill of the North Platte River was computed, by multiplying the volume of saturated material by the average storage coefficient, to be 1,700,000 acre-feet. It was computed that about 21,000 acre-feet of water is in storage in the uppermost foot of the saturated material.
Sufficient data were not available to approximate the total amount of discharge from Goshen County; however, it was determined that in the 4 years of study an average of about 305,000 acre-feet of ground water was discharged annually from the North Platte River project area. About 217,000 acre-feet was discharged by streams and drains, about 59,000 acre-feet by evaportranspiration (including about 3,000 acre-feet of the water pumped from wells), and about 29,000 acre-feet as underflow through the valley fill.
Water in unconsolidated materials carries moderately low amounts of dissolved solids, principally calcium bicarbonate, and is characterized by hardness exceeding 200 ppm (parts per million), a substantial part of which is noncarbonate, by a low percentage of sodium, and locally, by excessive iron. The quantities of the individual constituents are influenced to some extent by irrigation practices. Water in the bedrock formations is characterized by low liardness and a high percentage of sodium. Water from the deeper Lance formation contains fiuoride in concentrations that exceed the desirable upper limits for drinking water used by children. Wells in the valley fill near the Interstate canal in general yield water having a slightly lower mineral content than wells adjacent to the North Platte River.
Local problems in water quality occur where drainage from irrigated tracts is retarded by underlying materials of low permeability and where concentration of the shallow water by evaporation and transpiration occurs.
Spot sampling of surface water showed that the Cherry Creek drain carries about 2.3 tons of dissolved solids per acre-foot of runoff before the start of irrigation, but the mineral content fluctuates widely in response to surface inflow during the irrigation season.
INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION
A program of ground-water investigation was begun in Wyoming
in November 1940 by the U. S. Geological Survey in cooperation with

4 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
the Wyoming State Planning and Water Conservation Board. As part of this program a study of Goshen County was begun in 1943 by J. B. Graham. The purpose was to evaluate the ground-water resources of the county by determining the character, thickness, and extent of the water-bearing materials; the source, occurrence, movement, quantity, and quality of the ground water; and the possibility of developing additional ground water. The study was discontinued early in 1944 and later, in 1948, was renewed as part of the cooperative program with the Wyoming State Engineer. A detailed study was made of the North Platte River irrigation project in Goshen County during 1949-51, as a part of the program of the Department of the Interior for development of the Missouri River basin. The data collected during that study are included in an open-file report 1 and most of the data are incorporated in this report. The field work and collection of data for this report were done by R. T. Littleton, F. N. Visher, H. M. Babcock, and J. R. Rapp under the general supervision of A. N. Sayre, chief of the Ground Water Branch of the Geological Survey. The investigation was completed and the report was compiled under the direct supervision of H. M. Babcock, district engineer for Wyoming.
The quality-of-water studies were made under the general supervision of S. K. Love, chief of the Quality of Water Branch of the Geological Survey, and P. C. Benedict, regional engineer in charge of the quality-of-water studies in the Missouri River basin.
The quantitative analyses of water-bearing materials were made by A. I. Johnson in the hydrologic laboratory of the Geological Sur vey at Lincoln, Nebr.
LOCATION AND EXTENT OF THE AREA
Goshen County lies in the southeastern part of Wyoming (fig. 1). It is bounded on the east by the Wyoming-Nebraska State line, and on the north, west, and south by Niobrara, Platte, and Laramie Counties, respectively. Goshen County is rectangular in shape and measures about 72 miles in a northerly direction and about 30% miles in an easterly direction. The county has an area of 2,186 square miles, which covers 48 complete townships and parts of 12 others.
METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
A network of 65 observation wells was established in March 1949 to observe water-level fluctuations in the area; included were 27 wells in which periodic water-level measurements had been made previously.

Measurements were made monthly from March 1949 through November 1951.
Eecords of 938 wells and springs in the area were obtained. Available information regarding the character and thickness of the water-bearing formations and the discharge of the wells was obtained from well drillers and well owners. An attempt was made to include all wells of large discharge. The depth to water below a fixed measuring point, generally the top of the well casing or the top of the pump base, in 812 wells was measured using a steel tape. The yield of 27 wells of large discharge was measured with a Hoff current meter. Small discharges were measured by timing with astopwatch the filling of a calibrated container. These measurements, as well as other information about the wells, are given in table 7. Eeported data are listed for most of the wells that could not be, measured. In addition to the wells inventoried, records of shotholes made during seismic surveys by oil companies were studied but are not included in this report. Instrumental levels were run to many of the wells and to the test holes. Chemical analyses were made of

6 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
12(6 water samples collected from wells, springs, drains, canals, and streams in the area.
The hydrologic properties of the tmconsolidated sand and gravel deposits were determined in the field by F. N. Visher, who made pumping tests of six wells. The physical and hydrologic properties of 21 samples of the bedrock formations were determined in the laboratory by A. I. Johnson at Lincoln, Nebr.
A study of the geology of the area was made by J. K. Kapp. Test drilling at 44 sites, a total of 6,152 feet, was supervised by Rapp and Visher, and the test holes were logged by Kapp.
The geologic and hydrologic field data were recorded on aerial photographs and were later transferred to a base map adapted from the Wyoming State Highway planning map. The wells shown on plate 4 were located within the sections by use of an odometer and by inspection of the aerial photographs; their locations are believed, to be accurate within (XI mile.
WELL-NUMBERING SYSTEM
The wells are numbered according to their location within the Bureau of Land Management's system of land subdivision. All wells are in the sixth principal meridian and baseline system. The well number shows the location of the well by township, range, section, and position wifliin the section. A graphical illustration of the wellnumbering system is shown in figure 2. The first numeral of a well number indicates the township, the second the range, and the third the section in which the well is located. The lowercase letters following the section number indicate the position of the well within the section. The first letter denotes the quarter section and the second the quarter-quarter section (40-acre tract). The subdivisions of the sections are lettered a, b, c, and d in a counterclockwise direction, beginning in the northeast quarter. Where more than one well is in a 40-acre tract, consecutive numbers beginning with 1 are added to the well number.
This numbering system was used also to designate test holes, locations where rock samples were collected for laboratory tests, and locations where surface-water samples were collected for chemical analysis.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Several investigations of the geology and water resources of the general area have been made previously. The reports on these studies proved very useful in the preparation of this report, and many references are made to them.
The geology and water resources of much of the county were described by Adams (1902) in a report on the Patrick and Goshen Hole quadrangles. A report by Smith (1903) on the Hartville quadrangle

describes a small section of the extreme western part of the county. Darton (1903) studied and mapped the geology of the Scotts Blun* quadrangle, Nebraska, which borders a part of Goshen County on the east. A soil survey was made by Veatch and McClure (1921) of

the Fort Laramie area, Wyoming and Nebraska, which includes part of the North Platte Eiver valley and part of Goshen Hole proper. Schlaikjer (1935a, b, and c) described the geology of the Goshen Hole area, which includes the part of the county south from the North Platte River to about the south boundary of T. 20 N. Wenzel, Cady, and Waite (1946) studied the geology and ground-water resources of Scotts Bluff County, Nebr., which borders part of the county on the east. Denson and Botinelly (1949) described the geology of the Hartville uplift, which includes the northwest corner of Goshen County.
During the course of this investigation the following three special studies were made in parts of the county. Babcock and Rapp (1952) described the geology and ground-^water resources along Horse and Bear Creeks, which covers an area in the southern part of the county. Visher and Babcock (1953) made a ground-water study in an area several miles southwest of the town of Torrington. Visher, Rapp, and Babcock 2 described the geology and ground-water resources of the part of the county that lies approximately between the Interstate and Fort Laramie canals. Many of the data compiled during these studies are incorporated in this report.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The writers wish to express their appreciation to all those who aided in this study. Well drillers in the area supplied logs for many of the wells, and oil companies made available their records of logs of test holes drilled during seismic surveys. The residents of the area supplied information about their wells and gave permission for the measurement of their wells, and for the drilling of test holes on their land. Information regarding public-supply wells was given by city and town officials of Torrington, Lingle, and Yoder. L. C. Bishop, State engineer of Wyoming, and Frank Murphy, chief hydrographer of Wyoming, gave helpful assistance and suggestions, and permitted access to records of wells and streamflow in the area. The management of the Goshen County Irrigation District gave helpful assistance and suggestions and permitted access to records of irrigation in the area. Personnel of the 17. S. Bureau of Reclamation assisted by determining the altitude of the land surface at test-hole sites.
GEOGRAPHY
HISTOBY
The history of Goshen County is closely associated with the different stages in the settling of the West. The North Platte River valley afforded an easy route for the early explorers and trappers, the cov-

ered wagons of the emigrants moving to the West, the cattlemen, and later the homesteaders.
The following summary of the history of Goshen County is based upon historical accounts of Wyoming, information obtained from the U. S. Park Service at the Fort Laramie National Monument, records of the U. S. Bureau of Eeclamation, and records of the U. S. Bureau of the Census.
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were prehistoric hunters whose flint dart points of the Folsom and Yuma types have been found in the valley of the North Platte River. At present there is no general agreement as to the age of these people, but they may have occupied the area 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. They were followed some time later by another hunting, nonagricultural people, whose implements have been found. Next came proto-Pawnee people of the Upper Republican culture, who tilled the soil, made pottery, and built semisubterranean houses. After these came the sedentary tribes of the true Pawnee Indians, who established farming villages of mud huts in the valleys and hunted on the adjacent plains. These Indians were living peacefully in the area when the white man first explored the Platte River valley. About 1760, Indians of the Sioux, or Dacotah, tribes, who then farmed and hunted in the forests south and west of Lake Superior, were defeated by the Chippewa Indians. The Sioux Indians, unable to defend themselves from the encroachment of the Chippewas, who had obtained guns from the French traders, gradually moved westward into the plains and assumed the culture of the Plains Indians. The Brule and Ogallala bands of the Dacotahs, with their allies, drove the established tribes of the Pawnee out of the North Platte Kiver valley.
Not long after the Louisiana Purchase, Americans began to exploit the fur resources of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains. In 1812, Robert Stuart, traveling eastward from Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River, reached the junction of the Laramie and Platte Rivers and gave what is apparently the first written description of the region. Ten years later the Rocky Mountain Fur Co. began operations in the area. Early in the summer of 1834, a trading station was established near the junction of the Laramie and Platte Rivers and called Fort William in honor of Capt. William L. Sublette. The fort soon became known as Fort Laramie after the Laramie River on which it was located. In 1849 the fort was taken over by the United States Government and a military unit was established to protect the emigrants who were traveling westward.
The history of the Oregon Trail as a wagon route began in 1830 when a party of trappers under the leadership of William L. Sublette set out for the Wind River in what is now Wyoming. In all there were 14 mule-drawn wagons, each loaded with 1,800 pounds of mer-

10 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
chandise. The wagons returned to St. Louis by way of the North Platte Eiver valley loaded with pelts. In 1832 Captain Bonneville led a wagon train to Oregon.
In 1841 the first organized band of about 80 homeseekers passed through the area bound for California and the Oregon country. This was the first of many wagon trains that went westward through the area along the Oregon Trail. In 1843 the first large group passed through the area it consisted of 260 men, 130 women, and 610 children in 200 wagons. In 1845, about 3,000 people traveled west through the area. For the next quarter of a century annual caravans and scores of independent companies took tens of thousands of emigrants westward to build new states in the Rocky Mountain country and on the Pacific coast. In 1848, from early spring until late summer, the Oregon Trail was lined with so many trains that they were scarcely out of sight of one another. The year 1849 probably was the most important year in the history of the Oregon Trail, because of the discovery of gold in California. Between May and October, it is reported that 30,000 to 100,000 people passed through Wyoming; they were the "forty-niners." The Oregon Trail remained the great thoroughfare of the covered wagon to the West until the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in the late 1860's, although wagons continued to follow the trail until late in the 1880's.
Led by Brigham Young, the first band of Mormons, which consisted of 149 people and 72 wagons, passed through the area in May 1847 on their way to settle in Salt Lake Valley. This began a largescale migration of the Mormons into the Utah territory. Many of the later Mormon emigrants made the entire trip on foot, pushing and pulling handcarts containing their supplies and cooking utensils.
The rapid growth of American settlements in California, Oregon, and Utah led to the establishment in 1850 of mail service between Independence, Mo., and Salt Lake City, Utah. During most of the 1850's Fort Laramie was the division point for the mail stages. Stages from each end of the line were scheduled to meet at the fort on the 15th of each month. However, regular mail schedules were difficult to maintain and the mail service was very slow and irregular. Not until the Pony Express was established in April 1860 was there a fast and reliable mail service in the West. The Pony Express could not compete with the Overland Telegraph, however, and was abandoned upon completion of the telegraph line in October 1861.
Following in the footsteps of the trappers, traders, and emigrants to the West came the permanent settlers. These hardy pioneers used their homestead rights to file on lands adjacent to the streams, and cooperatively with their own labor, teams, and equipment, built canals to bring water to their lands. The oldest adjudicated water right in

Goshen County is from Eawhide Creek, with a priority of 1S81. Thiswas followed by the construction of the North Platte canal in 1883,, the Torrington canal in 1886, and the Lucerne canal in 1892. Largescale irrigation began with the construction of the Whalen Falls Carey Act project in the early 1900's, followed by the building of the Interstate and Fort Laramie canals by the Reclamation Service in 1910.
After the completion of the large canals considerable additional land was brought under irrigation. This resulted in an increase in farm population, which in turn led to an increase in the population of the nearby towns. In recent years there has been a marked increase of the population in and adjacent to the larger towns in the valley of the North Platte River, especially Torrington, and a decrease in the population of the smaller towns. According to the 1950 census the population of Goshen County was 12,634, the Torrington area having: a population of 6,201, or almost half the total.

SURFACE FEATURES LAND FORMS
Goshen County lies in the northwestern part of the High Plains section of the Great Plains physiographic province. The major part of the High Plains section, or the area that lies south of the 41st parallel,, is a tableland constructed on fluviatile Tertiary deposits (Pliocene),, which are frequently referred to as the "Tertiary mantle" (Fenneman, 1931). The rest, or northern part, of the High Plains section owes it& relatively flat surface features to extensive erosion (mainly of Miocene deposits) to a uniform slope, which was accomplished mainly by stream action. Regionally, this surface consists of broad, nearly flat or gently rolling tabular uplands between streams, with isolated buttes and outlying ridges. In Goshen County the original High Plains surface has been deeply eroded as the result of uplift, and the tablelands and lower buttes and ridges are incompletely eroded features of the North Platte River valley, which has been cut about 1,000 feet intothe plains. The surface features of Goshen County can be separated into three main topographic units: the upland areas, a section of the Hartville Hills, and the western part of the Goshen Hole lowland.

UPLAND AREAS
The upland areas comprise about the north third of the county, part of the western margin, and the southwest corner of the county. In the northern part of the county, in the area east of the Hartville Hillsr the Tertiary deposits have been dissected into moderate relief by the drainage systems of Rawhide and Sheep Creeks. The upland area along the west boundary and in the southwestern part of the county is a divide area and consists of a more or less gently rolling tableland. As this area mainly is underlain by permeable materials, there is little

12 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
or no surface runoff from it; consequently, the old tableland surface has only been moderately eroded by stream action. Although the surface is remaining more or less intact, the margins of the uplands are slowly retreating, owing to the erosion of the bordering escarpment faces by ground water which issues as springs and seeps.
HARTVILIiE HILLS
In the northwestern part of Goshen County the relatively gentle topography of the upland area is broken by the Hartville Hills. This range of hills is comparatively rugged, owing to recurrent erosion of the old, resistant Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks of which it is made. Though the range has a mountainous appearance, the overall relief is only moderate. The most striking difference in altitude is in the Haystack Range on the east side of Whalen Canyon, where the rise from the bottom of the canyon to the summit of the range, in a distance of 1 mile, is nearly 1,000 feet. In,: many«plaiaess; alongrfcteeast side of the range there are many resistant knobs, of no great altitude, that project through the Tertiary rocks.
GOSHEN HOLE LOWLAND
In the central, western, and southern parts of the county the upland are,a,is terminated abruptly by a line of escarpments and topographic breaks which give way to the western part of an extensive erosional lowland, known as the Goshen Hole lowland. The Goshen Hole lowland, which in most places is clearly defined by escarpments, is a great wedge-shaped widening of the valley of the North Platte River. (See fig. 3.) The lowland is about 45 miles wide on the west in the vicinity of Fort Laramie, Wyo., and narrows to about 2 miles on the east in the vicinity of Lisco, Nebr.; it is about 100 miles.long. Several erosional outliers break the continuity of the lowland and, owing to their sharp rise from the floor of the lowland, are prominent surface features when viewed from the valley. The main outliers are Wildcat Ridge in Nebraska, which includes the well-known, historic salient, Scotts Bluff; and Sixty-six and Bear Creek Mountains in Goshen County, Wyo. In Goshen County the lowland consists mainly of two more or less distinct topographic units the valley of the North Platte River on the north, and Goshen Hole proper on the south.
VALLEY OF THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER
The valley of the North Platte River consists of an inner valley and a series of bordering pediments. The inner valley consists of a flood plain and from one to three alluvial terraces that border the flood plain. The terraces grade into a series of sweeping pediments which extend away from the river to the upland. The terraces and pediments

on the north side of the valley are best preserved because, for the most part, they are underlain by gravel deposits, which, being pervious, resist erosion. On the south side of the valley, where little or no gravel was deposited, the older surfaces largely have been destroyed by erosion, which formed younger pediments graded to the lower levels of the river.
In the upland areas north of the river there are several remnants of surfaces that were formed when the river and its tributaries were at considerably higher levels than at present. Many of these remnants are underlain by gravel deposits which are older, truncated, channel deposits or which were derived mainly from channel deposits.
The highest gravel deposits above the river occur on top of Spoon Butte at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. They are about 900 feet above the present level of the North Platte River and probably correlate with the eighth terrace as described by Cady (Wenzel, Cadyr and Waite, 1946, p. 28-48). The next highest gravel deposits above the river occur on top of Pine Ridge and Casebier Hill where they overlie deposits of conglomerate. These gravel deposits were so intensively eroded that their origin could not be determined. However, because they occur at an altitude of about 800 feet above the present level of the river, they are correlated with the seventh terrace as described by Cady. About 650 feet above the North Platte River in the vicinity of Pine Ridge and on top of a hill in the southwestern part of T. 26 N., R. 60 W. are the next gravel deposits. The surface formed by these deposits is a pediment that probably correlates with the sixth terrace as described by Cady. The tops of the highest hills in the northern part of T. 25 N., R. 61 W., and in the southwestern part of T. 26 N., R. 61 W., and the relatively level area in the eastcentral part of T. 26 N., R. 63 W., are pediment remnants that lie between about 500 feet and about 380 feet above the present level of the river. This pediment is the second pediment above the third terrace level of the river, as described by Visher (Babcock and Visher, 1951, p. 9). The deposits underlying this surface probably are equivalent to those that underlie the fifth terrace as described by Cady. In part they are truncated channel deposits that probably would correlate with the Broadwater formation of Shultz and Stout (1948). The relatively extensive lowland in the central part of T. 26 N., Rs. 60 and 61 W., is a pediment remnant that lies between about 380 feet and about 280 feet above the present level of the river. It is the first pediment above the third terrace as described by Visher and probably is equivalent to the fourth terrace as described by Cady. In the eastern part of T. 25 N., R. 61 W., there is a pediment surface that slopes southward and merges with the third terrace. This surface slopes from about 450 to about 200 feet above the level of the river

GEOGRAPHY

15

and probably includes parts of both the first and second pediments .above the third terrace.
Eemnants of the third terrace, the highest and oldest of the three surfaces mapped as terraces rather than as pediments, occur at many places along the inner valley of the North Platte Eiver (see pi. 1). The most extensive remnant is on the north side of the river and extends eastward from about Eawhide Creek into Nebraska. It reaches a maximum width of about 4 miles. The riverward edge of this terrace generally is about 120 feet above the river, and the terrace surface slopes gently upward away from the river. The upslope boundary of the terrace generally is indistinct; it merges into alluvial fans and pediment slopes that extend upward to the remnants of the -older pediments or to the upland itself. Erosion has lowered the original surface of the terrace, as is evidenced by the gravel hills that stand above the general terrace level in the southern part of T. 25 N., E. 61 W. Dune sand covers most of the third terrace between the Arnold drain and the Nebraska-Wyoming State line. On the south ;side of the river, only narrow remnants of the third terrace are present.
Eemnants of the second terrace occur at many places on both sides of the river; however, the second terrace is best preserved between the Interstate canal and U. S. Highway 26 as a narrow strip half a mile wide that extends eastward from the center of E. 63 W. to the center of E. 64 W. The riverward edge of this terrace generally is 30 to 50 feet above the river. The surface of the terrace has been altered by the deposition of colluvium and alluvial fans, which slope upward away from the river at a gradient of about 70 feet to the mile. On the north side of the river the terrace surface generally is terminated on the landward side by a steep escarpment, but on the south side -of the river the terrace surface in many places is continuous with an extensive pediment that slopes upward away from the river.
The first terrace borders the flood plain of the North Platte Eiver and is from % to nearly 2 miles wide. This terrace has an irregular surface of very low relief as it is 10 to 20 feet above the river and is cut by a myriad of former channels of the river. Before the flow of the river was controlled by upstream dams, the first terrace is reported to have been inundated during very high floods.
Before the construction of the upstream dams, the flood plain, which is 5 to 10 feet above the river, normally was inundated during heavy .spring runoff. The flow of the river now is fairly well confined to its present braided channel, which contains many bars and islands.

GOSHEN HOLE FEOFEE
Goshen Hole proper is separated from the inner valley of the North Platte Eiver by a maturely dissected ridge of the Brule formation, <which in places is several hundred feet above the flood plain of the

16 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
river. (See pi. 1.) It is bounded on the northwest, the west, and thesouthwest by an escarpment that is several hundred feet high. (See plate 5.) On the south the escarpment is discontinuous; Bear Creek Mountain and Sixty-six Mountain are erosional outliers of the once continuous upland. The east boundary of Goshen Hole proper, which is poorly defined, is approximately the west side of Table Mountain. Goshen Hole proper can be defined better as including the lowland areadrained by Cherry Creek and the area drained by Horse Creek between its confluence with Bear Creek and the south Horse Creek lateral division.
Topographically Goshen Hole proper is a low plain and a series of sweeping pediments that in most places slope up to the rimming escarpment. In many places the plain and lower slopes of the pediments are mantled with slope-wash material, which is pockmarked with windblown depressions, some of which are more than 40 feet deep. The upper parts of some of the pediments are cut by gullies which open onto the middle or lower slopes. The rolling topography of the part of Goshen Hole proper underlain by the Lance formation reflects to some extent the unconformable surface between the Lance and. Chadron formations.
PHYSIOGRAPHIC HISTORY OF THE GOSHEN HOLE LOWLAND
VALLEY OF THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER
The dissection of the area by the North Platte Eiver began during Pliocene time and has continued to the present time. Before theNorth Platte Eiver began to downcut, it had shifted back and forth across the Tertiary alluvial plain. As it began downcutting, the river became established in essentially its present course. By the end of Pliocene time the river had cut down through about 700 feet of sediments to a height of perhaps 500 feet above its present level. In earliest Pleistocene time the channel, or valley, of the river was refilled to a level of about 650 feet above the present stream the materials that were deposited at this time probably are equivalent to the Broadwater formation of Schultz and Stout (1948) in western Nebraska. Subsequently, for a long period the river downcut, until it was about 200 feet above its present level. During this period of downcutting the valley of the river was cut below the contact of the Brule and Airkaree formations. Characteristically, springs flow down escarpment faces from along this contact; the underlying softer Brule formation is eroded, undermining the Airkaree formation and thereby causing the escarpments to retreat. In this manner the valley was widened rapidly as the escarpments retreated and left a pediment surface. This surface is the second pediment above the third terrace. When the pediment intersected the Brule-Arikaree contact

GEOGRAPHY

17

the rate of retreat of the escarpment decreased greatly, and the amount of material that was transported down the pediment slope from the retreating escarpment decreased. Later, minor valleys were cut into the relatively smooth pediment surface, and the sides of these valleys in turn were widened to form a new pediment the first pediment above the third terrace. Parts of the older pediment were protected by gravel deposits and preserved as isolated remnants in the present topography.
Later in Pleistocene time there was a period of rapid downcutting, which lowered the river to about 200 feet below its present level. Before this period of downcutting, Kawhide Creek was a Yazoo-type tributary that is, it paralleled the North Platte Kiver through the eastern part of the county; thus, when the main stream cut down, the tributary cut a deep valley parallel to it. These valleys were afterwards refilled to about 180 feet above the present level of the river. The remnants of this valley fill are the deposits of the third terrace. (See pi. 1.)
After the valley was filled with the deposits of the third terrace the North Platte River became mainly a degrading stream. It cut into the deposits of the third terrace and reworked some of the older alluvial deposits as each successive terrace level was formed. Either in latest Pleistocene or early Kecent time, the river cut down to about 30 feet above its present level and formed a flood plain that was from 1/2 to 2,1/2 miles wide. There followed a period of reduced flow in the river during which this flood plain was largely covered with a thin veneer of colluvium and alluvial-fan material. The remnants of this surface constitute the second terrace. After this, the river again increased in erosive power and cut down to within 20 feet of its present level and formed a new flood plain that was almost as wide as the previous one, and removed most of the second terrace. This flood plain constitutes the first terrace. The river then cut to its present level.
GOSHEN HOLE PROPER
The formation of Goshen Hole proper was generally similar to, but in some respects different from, the formation of the valley of the North Platte River. As the river valley was cut below the OligoceneMiocene (Brule-Arikaree) contact, several tributary streams whose courses were through the area now occupied by Goshen Hole proper also cut down below the contact. Goshen Hole began to form with the retreat of the escarpments along the contact. At this time Chugwater Creek was working headward toward the south from the Laramie River and intercepted the headwaters of the eastward-flowing streams that entered Goshen Hole. A tributary working southward from the North Platte River through Goshen Hole intercepted and

18 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
diverted Bear Creek and then Horse Creek into Goshen Hole. Before this piracy their course extended along what is now the valley of Pumpkin Creek in Nebraska. The erosional processes of the expanding Goshen Hole were dependent mainly upon the local climate; whereas the erosion in the valley of the North Platte Eiver was dependent upon the amount of runoff in the headwaters as well as upon the local climate. During the wetter periods large amounts of material were eroded from the escarpments and older pediments, and these were carried by the streams from Goshen Hole to the North Platte River. However, during drier periods such as the present, there was a decrease in erosion and essentially no external drainage from much of Goshen Hole. The small amounts of material eroded during these drier periods were deposited as alluvial fans in Goshen Hole, but these largely were removed by wind. Gradually these erosional processes exhumed some of the pre-Tertiary topography and produced a very irregular landscape within parts of Goshen Hole.
DRAINAGE
Goshen County is drained mainly by the North Platte River and its tributaries. The only other drainage system in the county is that of the Niobrara River, which drains the extreme northeastern part of the county. The rest of the area north of the North Platte River is drained by Sheep Creek in the east, Rawhide Creek in the center and northwest, and many small dry washes in the west. The area south of the river is drained by Horse Creek and its tributaries in the south and east, the Katzer drain in the east, the Cherry Creek drain and several small intermittent streams in the center, and several dry washes and the Laramie River in the west.
The North Platte River is a perennial stream throughout its course in Goshen County. The flow of the river is controlled by several upstream dams which release water according to downstream irrigation demands. Before the construction of the dams, the river had rather pronounced seasonal stages of high and low flow. Sheep Creek is an intermittent stream along the part of its course that lies in Goshen County. Rawhide Creek is a perennial stream throughout its course in the county. Horse Creek and its principal tributary, Bear Creek, are perennial streams throughout their courses in the county. Cherry Creek, which drains the northern part of Goshen Hole, was an ephemeral stream throughout its course before irrigation began, and flowed only during periods of heavy precipitation. Because of surface- and ground-water runoff from irrigation, the lower part of Cherry Creek (or the part of the creek lying east of the Fort Laramie canal) has become a perennial stream. This part of the creek is now called the Cherry Creek drain; it has entrenched itself as much as 35 feet below

GEOGRAPHY

19

the bottom of its valley since irrigation was started. The Laramie Kiver, which rises in the mountains to the west, is a perennial stream and in the county is second in size only to the main North Platte Eiver. During the winter its flow is diverted into the Fort Laramie canal for use in generating power at the Lingle power station.

CLIMATE
The climate of the area is similar to that of other parts of the northern High Plains. It is characterized by low precipitation, a high rate of evaporation, and a wide range in temperature. The annual precipitation during the 30-year period of record and the normal monthly precipitation (computed through 1950) for the station at Torrington, Wyo., are shown graphically in figure 4. The normal precipitation

is 14.36 inches; the highest recorded annual precipitation was 20.91 inches and the lowest was T.ll inches. About 51 percent of the annual

precipitation occurs during April, May, and June; only about 11 percent occurs during November, December, January, and February, when it generally is in the form of light, dry snow. The summer rains, which are usually sporadic and unevenly distributed, occur largely as thunderstorms. Occasionally these storms are accompanied by strong winds and hail, which cause considerable damage to crops.
The mean annual temperature is 4T.5° F., and the length of the growing season generally is about 150 days. There is a wide range between the maximum summer and the minimum winter temperature, and also between maximum daytime and minimum nightime tempera-

ture.

AGRICULTURE

The present agricultural economy of the county has been developed largely through irrigation, dry farming, and stock raising. The lower lands, that is, those having access to surface-water supplies, generally are intensively utilized. Usually the supply of surface water is sufficient for irrigation, but shortages occur during periods of peak de-

20 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
mand because of inadequate distribution facilities and also during periods of very low runoff in the drainage basin of the North Platte River. To overcome the shortages, some farmers have installed irrigation wells that are pumped for a supplementary water supply. The lands without surface-water supplies generally are used for dry farming and for raising cattle. However, some of the land outside the irrigation projects is irrigated with water from wells. The chief crops raised in the county are sugar beets, potatoes, beans, hay, and grain. Most of the,livestock are beef cattle, although some dairy cattle, sheep, and hogs are raised.
The main industries in Goshen County are directly related to the processing of agricultural products; the largest industry is a sugar plant at Torrington, which extracts sugar from locally grown sugar beets.
TRANSPORTATION
Goshen County is served by lines of two railroads. The Casper branch of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad follows the fnorth,bank of the North Platte Rives? across ths county. A Ipranch of the Union Pacific Railroad for which Torrington is the terminal station serves the southern part of the county and joins the main line of the railroad to the south. The county is traversed by two main highways U. S. 26 in an easterly direction, and U. S. 85 in a northerly direction. There are several black-top surfaced State and county roads, and other county roads that are graveled and maintained throughout the year.
GEOLOGY
SUMMARY OF STRATIGRAPHY
Goshen County is underlain by a considerable thickness of sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Cambrian to Recent that lie on crystalline rocks of pre-Cambrian age. The age, thickness, physical character, and water supply of these formations are sufninaTized below. The areas of outcrop of the formations exposed in the county are shown on plate 1.
The pre-Tertiary formations exposed in the county are pre-Cambrian, Cambrian(?), Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Late Cretaceous in age. All the pre-Tertiary rocks except the Lance formation of Late Cretaceous age lie at great depths beneath most of the county. These depths are considered excessive for the economic development of the formations as sources of ground water; therefore, these formations will not be discussed further. (For detailed descriptions of these rocks the reader is referred to the publications cited on page 94:.

GEOLOGIC HISTORY
PALAEOZOIC AND MESOZOIC ERAS
Very few rocks of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age are exposed in Goshen County, but the geologic section underlying the county is complete sofar as the regional sequence of formations is concerned. Deep oil tests in the county and outcrops of the rocks in nearby areas furnish data on the unexposed rocks for the following brief discussion bf the geologic history of the county.
The basal sedimentary rock in the county is Cambrian (?) quartzite (Denson and Botinelly, 1949), which was laid down as sand on the beaches or near the shore of the Cambrian sea. During the rest of early Paleozoic time, until deposition again occurred in Devonian time,, the area was a land surface, or if any sediments were laid down they subsequently were eroded away. During Devonian and Mississippian time the sea invaded the area and thick deposits of limestone were laid down to form the Guernsey formation. Later during Mississippian,. Pennsylvanian, and Permian (?) time the sea became shallower, probably because of gradual uplift of the land, and beds of sand, sandy and pure limestone, and marine clay were laid down to form most of the Hartville formation. As emergence of the land continued, shoreline conditions prevailed and the sand at the top of the Hartville formation was deposited. Total emergence of the land during the first part of Permian time is indicated by the continental deposits of mud,, silt, and sand that compose the Opeche shale. Then the sea again temporarily invaded the area and pure and muddy limestone were laid down to form the Minnekahta limestone. Later in Permian time the land again completely emerged to form wide mud flats. At this time the climate was arid and the mud, silt, and gypsum of the socalled gypsum and red-shale sequence were laid down.
In early Mesozoic time, during the Triassic period, local shallow basins and extensive mud flats predominated under prevailingly arid conditions and the gypsum and gypsiferous red clay, silt, and sand of the Chugwater formation were laid down. Chugwater deposition ended with regional uplift which resulted in general planation that continued into Jurassic time. Then a submergence of the land took place and, under shoreline conditions, sands and clays were deposited during Sundance time. Shoreline conditions gave way to continental conditions and, under a prevailingly humid climate, fresh-water clays and sands were laid down during Morrison time. At the beginning of Cretaceous time there was some uplift, after which nearshore deposits were laid down to form the Cloverly formation. Then the sea advanced and, during the remainder of Early and most of Late Cretaceous time, several thousand feet of marine clay and sand were deposited. These deposits comprise the Benton shale, the Niobrara for-

mation, and the Pierre shale. The sea then began to retreat and in the latter part of Fox Hills time a considerable thickness of sand was laid down on -thte great series of marine clay ancb'sarict After' the retreat of the Cretaceous sea the area was occupied by extensive bodies of brackish water and then fresh water in which were deposited the sand, clay, and carbonaceous material of the Lance formation. During: about the middle of Lance time the Cannonball sea advanced into North and South Dakota. A brackish-water estuary or inlet extended into Goshen County, Wyo., and brackish-water deposits were laid down; this was the last invasion of the area by a sea. Subsequently, continental deposition was resumed, and the Cretaceous period ended with extensive mountain making.

CENOZOIC EKA
TERTIARY PERIOD
During Paleocene and Eocene time, or during the time between the close of the Mesozoic era and the beginning of Oligocene deposition, the area was uplifted and then, being topographically high, was eroded by streams. The extent of this erosion is not known, but a large regional basin was formed. This basin probably had a relatively rugged topography that consisted of moderately high hills and stream channels that were several hundred feet deep. Oligocene time beganwith erosion that later gave way to alluviation by a system of streams that crossed the area generally from west to east. These stream deposits, which constitute the lower unit of the Chadron formation, in part were probably derived locally from the Lance formation: however, the main source of the materials is not known. As materials continued to bedeposited, the streams began to meander, as evidenced by the sinuous channel sandstone in the upper unit of the Chadron formation. At this time the clay, silt, and the occasional limy beds that later consolidated to form the claystone, siltstone, and limestone of the upperunit were deposited as stream and lake deposits. The deposition of the Brule formation during the remainder of Oligocene time occurred under conditions that generally were similar to those that prevailed during the latter part of Chadron deposition, no definite break occurring in the deposition of the two formations. However, the larger grain size of the materials that compose the Brule formation, indicates that some renewed activity, either uplift or volcanism or both, took place to the west of the area. The character of the sediments comprising the Brule formation indicate that the sediments were deposited in a large basin that contained small fresh-water lakes, and mud flats and meandering streams.
At the beginning of Miocene time, uplift in the Laramie Range to the west rejuvenated the eastward-flowing streams to such an extent that they deposited very coarse materials in their channels. These ^

26 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
coarse materials make up the basal unit of the Arikaree formation. Subsequently, the fine sand of the Arikaree formation in the region was deposited by widely meandering streams, aided to a minor extent by wind. During much of Pliocene time the area seemingly was topographically high, and relatively little deposition is known to have taken place. During the latter part of Pliocene time, however, the streams aggraded their channels for a time; but for the most part they were degrading. Possibly during early or middle Pliocene time, the central part of the county was upwarped in the form of an arch, and some faulting took place in the area at this time as well as later during the Quaternary period. In late Pliocene time the North Platte Biver is thought to have flowed in essentially its present course. At the end of Pliocene time, considerable uplift of the mountains to the west took place.
QUATERNARY PERIOD
During early and middle Pleistocene time, the uplift of the mountains to the. west and the increase in precipitation rejuvenated the streams. During this time the North Platte Kiver and its principal tributaries in the area were mainly degrading streams; therefore, little or no deposition took place. Then the climate became drier and the streams began to alluviate. At this time the flood plain of the North Platte Kiver, which followed essentially its present course, was about 200 feet higher than the present level of the river. The lower course of Kawhide Creek was approximately parallel to and north of that of the river. In the latter part of Pleistocene time there was renewed downcutting by the streams the North Platte Kiver cut a channel about 200 feet below its present level, and Kawhide Creek deepened its channel accordingly. Subsequently the two streams alluviated and refilled their valleys to about 180 feet above the present level of the river. Remnants of this valley fill are the third-terrace deposits. During the subsequent formation of the lower terraces and the present flood plains, the streams reworked the valley fill to unknown depths. This reworking is indicated by the greater permeability of these deposits.
The river later cut down to about 30 feet above its present level and formed a flood plain that was from ^ to 2i/£ miles wide. During this time the flow of the river was reduced and materials that were derived from the valley sides were deposited as colluvium on the flood plain, the remnants of which are the second terrace. The erosive power of the river again was increased and the river lowered its flood plain to within 20 feet above its present level. This level is well preserved and constitutes the first terrace. Since then the river has cut to the level of its present flood plain. While in the process of forming the second and first terraces and the flood plain, the river reworked the underlying valley fill to unknown depths.

CRETACEOUS SYSTEM
LANCE FORMATION
Character. In Goshen County the Lance formation of Late Cretaceous age consists of two distinct units: a lower unit that consists predominantly of dark materials, and an upper unit that consists of a sequence of light, variegated beds. The color distinction between the two units probably is due mainly to weathering of the upper unit but partly to the greater abundance of carbonaceous material in the lower unit Thin beds of coal occur in both units of the formation but they are more numerous in the lower unit.
The lower unit consists of a thick sequence of beds of carbonaceous shale, gray siltstone, and dark- to light-gray sandstone, and thin beds of coal throughout the sequence. This unit does not crop out in the report area, but it was penetrated in drilling wells and test holes.
The upper unit consists of a colorful sequence of beds of sandstone and soft shale. The extreme upper part of the unit consists mainly of platy clay that is red, blue, green, brown, and brownish yellow, with no restriction of color to individual beds. Contained in this clay zone are a few thin dark-gray beds of carbonaceous soft shale, and lenses of dark- to very-light-gray loosely to well-cemented sandstone, some of which contain moderately hard yellowish-brown sandstone concretions. These lenses of sandstone are somewhat similar to the channel deposits of sandstone in the upper unit of the overlying Chadron formation, but they are lacking in the many very small flakes of biotite that are contained in the Chadron. Below the predominantly shaly unit is a relatively thick sequence of beds that is mostly sandstone and partly soft shale. The beds of sandstone range from yellow to white, are very fine to fine grained, and for the most part are loosely -cemented. These beds contain very hard dark-brown sandstone and ironstone concretions, which are as much as 2 feet in diameter and weather into typical concave-convex fragments. The beds of shale mainly are yellowish brown, but a few are carbonaceous and therefore are dark gray.
The unit contains a few thin beds of coal, a few thin beds of impure limestone that contain oyster shells, and brown pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of chert. Schlaikjer (1935a, p. 31-68) subdivided this upper unit into three parts: a lower continental deposit 100-200 feet thick that contains ceratopsian and other reptilian remains; a middle brackish-water deposit 80-125 feet thick; and an upper continental deposit *60-100 feet thick, that contains in its upper portion a new and very advanced form of Triceratops.

Extent and thickness. The Lance formation is exposed in the southcentral part of the county. Its areas of outcrop are irregular because, after deposition, it was deformed and uplifted and then subjected to erosion. Streams cut deeply into the Lance formation and subsequently filled their channels with sediments; hence, in many places the younger Chadron formation either overlaps the Lance formation or occurs as outliers within it.
The thickness of the Lance formation ranges from a knife edge to about 1,400 feet. The greatest thickness found in the county was in an oil test in sec. 32, T. 22 N., R. 63 W., where about 1,400 feet was penetrated. In this well about 300 feet of the upper unit of the formation is present; the remaining 1,100 feet represents the lower unit.
Water supply. The Lance formation supplies water to a large number of domestic and stock wells in the south-central part of the county. Also, it supplies water to both the municipal and the railroad wells at the town of Yoder. The most productive of these wells is reported to yield about 100 gpm. Possibly larger quantities of water could be developed from the formation, but it is doubtful that these would be adequate for irrigation or large industrial needs. Water is yielded from sandstone beds in the formation and generally is under artesian pressure, which in places is sufficient to bring the water to the land surface.
TERTIARY SYSTEM
Tertiary sedimentary rocks in the area include the Chadron and Brule formations of Oligocene age and the Arikaree formation of Miocene age. The ages of the formations were determined by vertebrate remains, and by lithology and stratigraphic position.
OLIGOCENE SERIES
CHADEON POEMATION
In Goshen County only the upper part of the Chadron formation is typical of the formation as it occurs in adjacent areas. The lower

GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES 29
part of the formation consists of a series of variegated fluviatile deposits which, in the main, are strikingly different from the upper part of the formation. Schlaikjer (1935b, p. 69-97) proposed the use of the term Yoder formation for these beds; however, later studies by J. E. Hough (oral communication, 1951) and by P. O. McGrew (oral communication, 1951) indicated that the Yoder formation should be considered as part of the Chadron formation. However, owing to the differences between this lower unit and the rest of the formation, it is discussed separately.
Lower wnit. The lower unit is of fluviatile origin and consists of a series of lenses and beds of deposits that range in grain size from clay through coarse to very coarse gravel; the coarsest materials represent channel deposits. The overall color is red; the beds of clay and silt are brick red, dark red, green to blue green, and buff; and the beds of sandstone and conglomerate are brick red, maroon, purple, and green. Two samples of the most permeable deposits were collected near the town of Yoder for mechanical analysis. The grain-size distribution, by weight, is given below.

The channel deposits in the western part of the county contain coarse to very coarse gravel; in the eastern part of the county the deposits are mainly fine- to medium-grained sand. Sample 23-62-29dc2 is thought to be typical of most of the finer grained channel deposits.
Except for the extreme upper part, the unit is quite distinctive because of its overall red color. It crops out in several places in the area, but the areas of outcrop are not very extensive. The largest of these is in the vicinity of the town of Yoder; a good section of the unit is exposed in a cut of the Fort Laramie canal about a mile northwest of Yoder. For the most part, the material is loosely consolidated and is easily eroded. The extent of the unit is imperfectly known because of the irregular occurrence of its areas of outcrop, but it is known to underlie the area south of the North Platte River from Yoder eastward to about the Wyoming-Nebraska State line. In test hole 24r-62-26da, 95 feet of the unit was penetrated this probably represents about its maximum thickness in the county.

30 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
Water in sufficient quantities for domestic and stock use very likely could be developed from the coarse-grained channel deposits of the unit. However, to locate these channel deposits by drilling probably would be difficult, owing to the irregular distribution of the unit and the sinuous courses of the channel deposits. Some wells in the county probably produce water from the lower unit, but logs of wells that might be producing from the unit are not sufficiently detailed to show accurately the source of the water supply.
Upper unit. The upper unit consists mainly of green, brown, red, or buff bentonitic loosely to moderately cemented clay and silt. The upper unit is sandy in places, and coarse-grained channel deposits occur at different horizons but are concentrated near the top. In addition, the upper unit contains a few lenticular beds of limestone and volcanic ash.
Although the upper unit consists predominantly of clay, the uppermost part of it consists mainly of silt with an admixture of clay and sand in places the top is marked by the top of channel-sandstone deposits. The percentage distribution of grain sizes, by weight, for seven samples of the uppermost part of the unit is given below.

The three samples collected at 23-62-lbb are of clayey silt from the transitional zone (which in a few places contains minor channel deposits of sandstone) in the uppermost part of the Chadron formation; they are listed in descending order. The transitional zone is overlain by the Brule formation and is underlain by the typical clay of the Chadron formation. Samples 24-62-12ca4, 12ca5, and 12ca6 were collected respectively, from immediately below the contact of the Brule and Chadron formations, from 3i/£ feet below the contact, and from Qi/2 feet below the contact. At this locality, the uppermost channel sandstone is about 20 feet beneath the top of the formation. In places, the upper part of the unit consists of channel deposits of

GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES 31

loosely to well-cemented sand and gravel. In the western part of Goshen Hole proper, these deposits contain a considerable amount of

gravel, some of which is very coarse, but eastward they grade into fine- to coarse-grained sandstone. The two samples that were collected from a channel sandstone at 24r-62-26cb consist mainly of fine to coarse

sand. The sample collected at 24-62-26bc consists predominantly of silt but is considered to represent the Chadron formation because it

was taken from below a channel sandstone, the top of which marks

the top of the Chadron formation.

"*.

In places the upper unit is gray, owing to concentrations of volcanic

ash. Lenses of relatively pure volcanic ash probably occur in the unit

but, owing to the gentle relief on the formation and to the cover of

eolian and slope-wash materials, none are exposed on the surface. Several limestone beds, which are very near the base of the unit, crop out in sees. 25, 26, and 34, T. 23 N., E. 63 W. The limestone is light

pink and granular, and contains disseminated grains of calcite, quartz, and basic minerals and thin lenses of clay pebbles (1 to 2 millimeters

in diameter). Because it is soft and fine grained, the upper unit typically weath-

ers to a gently undulating topography characterized by small, wellrounded hills. In places the resistant channel deposits of sandstone form mesalike prominences. The unit is exposed throughout much

of the central part of Goshen Hole proper and in the valley of the

North Platte Kiver; it underlies younger formations in many other

parts of the county. The upper unit ranges in thickness from a knife

edge to about 100 feet in most of its area of outcrop, but its is as much

as 150 feet thick in the eastern and southeastern parts of Goshen Hole proper.

The upper unit yields small quantities of water to many domestic

and stock wells in the central part of the county. The water is produced from sandstone channel deposits and generally is under artesian pressure, which in some wells is sufficient to cause the water to flow at the surface. The channel-sandstone deposits generally are narrow,

sinuous, and widely separated; therefore, they are difficult to locate by drilling.

BEULE FORMATION

Character. The Brule formation, of Oligocene age, consists of buff, moderately hard, brittle argillaceous siltstone that is sandy at

the top and in places at the base. It contains moderately thick channel deposits of sand and sandstone, localized beds of limestone, moderately thick beds of clay, and a few beds of volcanic ash. In places it lies

unconformably on the Chadron formation; elsewhere the contact is conformable. In most places the Brule is overlain unconformably by the Arikaree formation.

32 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
The lower part of the Brule formation is sandy in places. In the area south of Torrington, channel deposits of sand and sandstone as much as 20 feet thick occur about 20 feet above the base of the formation. Laterally the channel deposits grade into sandy siltstone, which grades into the massive siltstone of the formation. Above this zone is a thick section that is predominantly siltstone and which constitutes about four-fifths of the formation. A few beds of pure volcanic ash occur in this part of the formation, but the volcanic ash mainly is admixed with reworked siltstone. Many of these reworked zones are channel deposits that grade laterally into the characteristic siltstone of the formation. The formation also contains thin lenticular beds of cherty limestone; several of these beds crop out along the ridge south of the town of Torrington and on Table Mountain. In places the limestone beds contain silicified gastropod shells and streaks of chalcedony and agate.
The upper part of the Brule formation consists of a moderately well consolidated admixture of silt and very fine grained sand, which is intermediate between that of typical deposits of the Brule and of the Arikaree. This part of the formation is fairly persistent and occurs as a relatively uniform deposit on Sixty-six and Bear Creek Mountains and on most of the escarpment surrounding Goshen Hole. On the escarpment about 7 miles southwest of I<mgle, where the Brule formation is overlain by the basal conglomerate of the Arikaree formation, the upper part of the Brule consists of typical silt and sand interbedded with lenses of conglomerate, and the contact with the Arikaree is indistinct and difficult to establish.
Barite crystals occur throughout much of the Brule formation. The crystals occur as fill in cavities, in columnar or spheroidal clusters in which most of the crystals are very small, or they occur as fill in fractures in which the individual crystals may be as much as half an inch across. Calcium carbonate also occurs as cavity or fracture fill throughout most of the formation; it occurs in both its amorphous and crystalline (calcite) forms. These deposits probably are of secondary origin, but the calcium carbonate probably was deposited in disseminated form with the other materials of the formation during deposition, and later was concentrated in the voids.
Mechanical analyses of six samples of the Brule formation indicate that it is composed mainly of silt and varying amounts of clay and sand. The percentage of silt in the samples ranged from 53.8 to 77.6, and averaged about 70. The weight percentage by grain
size of the samples is given below.

Samples 19-62-lbbl and Ibb2 were collected on the steep south slope of Bear Creek Mountain, about 100 feet below the top of the formation. Three samples collected at 24-62-12ca represent the lower part of the formation; the first sample was taken about 32 feet above the contact of the Brule and Chadron formations; the second, about 14 feet above the contact; and the third, immediately above the contact. Three other samples were collected at this location from below the contact; the results of the analyses of those three samples are included in the discussion of the upper unit of the Chadron formation. Sample 24-62-15dc was taken about 300 feet above the contact of the Brule and Chadron formations.
The Brule formation is cut by many fractures, fractured zones, fissures, and faults these are especially in evidence on weathered surfaces. Many of these fractures, the result of weathering, are small and superficial and are filled with clastic materials, calcium carbonate (calcite), or barium sulfate (barite). There are also zones of fractures that are quite different from the fractures caused by weathering. The zones are made up of loosely assembled blocks or chunks of siltstone, which may be spaced as much as half an inch apart, and have a shattered appearance. One of these zones was found beneath a cover of detritus in sec. 20, T. 24 N., R. 61 W., and another was exposed in sec. 1, T. 23 N., R. 61 W., where a bulldozer had removed the overlying loose material. The fissures, which range in width from about 1 inch to about 2i/£ feet, probably extend the entire thickness of the formation. They probably resulted from warping, either regional or local, or both. Other than on badland surfaces the fissures are difficult to detect, as they are covered by eolian and fluviatile deposits, but parts of their surface traces can be determined on aerial photographs. The fractured zones and fissures constitute lines of weakness which generally show up on aerial photographs. The surface expression of a fissure is shown in plate 6.
Faults also cut the Brule formation, but they do not seem to be as numerous as the fractures and fissures. Only a few faults were

34 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
detected, owing to the homogeneity of the formation and to the cover of loose materials, but undoubtedly there are many more. The most conspicuous fault is the Whalen fault, which has an estimated TOO feet of vertical displacement of beds with the upthrow on the west.
Extent and thickness. The Brule formation crops out in much of the central and southern parts of Goshen County. It makes up the bases and lower slopes of escarpments that surround the Goshen Hole lowland, and its area of outcrop has the appearance of a broken ring that is somewhat elongated northwestward into the inner valley of the North Platte Eiver. Several erosional outliers occur; south of Torrington is one that is 13 miles long in an easterly direction. In Goshen County the Brule formation ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 450 feet.
Water supply. Generally, the Brule formation, which consists mainly of an argillaceous siltstone that is relatively impermeable, does not yield water abundantly to wells. However, most wells in the formation produce small quantities of water for domestic and stock purposes from fractures. Lenses of sandstone in the formation also are thought to yield small quantities of water to wells.
In the southern part of the county near Lagrange, fissures and fractured zones yield relatively large quantities of water to irrigation wells. Yields of as much as 870 gpm are obtained from wells that tap both fractures and fissures in the Brule formation and sand and, gravel in the overlying alluvium. Logs of successful irrigation wells in this area show a moderate thickness of saturated alluvium above the Brule formation. Water percolates downward through overlying permeable materials into interconnecting fractures and fissures, through which the water is transmitted to the wells.
In places in Goshen County additional supplies of water for irrigation probably could be developed from fractured zones and fissures in the Brule formation. The stream valleys, such as that of Horse Creek in the vicinity of Lagrange, are the most likely areas for further development, because they contain great thicknesses of saturated, coarse-grained materials that overlie the Brule formation. However, test drilling would be required to determine the location of the fractured zones.
MIOCENE SERIES
Generally, the deposits of Miocene age in Goshen County constitute a fairly homogeneous, mappable unit. Detailed geologic and paleontologic work in western Nebraska, however, has demonstrated that the Miocene deposits, at least in Nebraska, can be divided into smaller, mappable units. The following tabulation of Miocene deposits in adjacent areas in western Nebraska was abstracted from table 1 in the report by Lugn (1939, p. 1245-1276)

GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES 35
Unconformity Hemingford group 250-400 feet (1) Sheep Creek formation 140-300 feet Unconformity (2) Marsland formation (old "Upper Harrison") 125-200 feet
Unconformity Arikaree group 700-800 feet (1) Harrison formation 200 feet (2) Monroe Creek formation 375 feet (3) Gering formation 100-200 feet
Unconformity
In places in Goshen County lateral equivalents of some of these formations were recognized or have been reported, but the scope of this report did not warrant the necessary detailed study needed to subdivide accurately the sandstones of Miocene age. Of the above-mentioned formations all those of the Arikaree group of Lugn (1939) and the Marsland formation of the Hemingford group of Lugn (1939) probably are present in Goshen County. The complexities of the problem of subdividing the Miocene deposits is evidenced by the conflicts in the data presented by Schlaikjer (1935c, p. 111-120) and Lugn (1939, p. 1251-54, p. 1268-69) and by others. As these deposits are fairly homogeneous and seemingly have similar water-bearing properties, they are herein grouped under Arikaree formation.

Character. In Goshen County the Arikaree formation consists mainly of loosely to moderately cemented very fine to fine grained tan to gray sand and silt that contain layers and concretions of hard, tough fine to very fine grained brown to gray sandstone; it contains also a few beds of white to gray volcanic ash, thick basal channel deposits of conglomerate, zones of loosely to moderately consolidated fine to very fine grained sand that are either markedly to slightly crossbedded or thinly laminated, and beds of white to light-gray volcanic ash. In places, the lithology of the lower part of the formation is quite different from that of the overlying part, and, for this reason, the two divisions of the formation are discussed separately as the basal unit and the upper unit. On plate 1, however, these units are not identified but are shown together as the Arikaree formation.
In Goshen County, the basal unit for the most part is a conglomerate that was laid down as channel deposits. These deposits consist of lenses of medium- to coarse-grained loosely to well-cemented sandstone that are interbedded with lenses of loosely to well-cemented conglomerate, which range in grain size from very fine gravel through large boulders. The conglomerate consists of pebbles of quartzite, granite, basic rocks, sandstone, chert, and limestone; red quartzite fragments (pebbles through large boulders) transported from the

36 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
Hartville Hills are conspicuous by their number, color, and size. This basal unit crops out mainly on the escarpment in the area west of Lingle, where the escarpment forms an approximate semicircle that extends on both sides of the valley of the North Platte River. The beds composing the channel deposits are unequally resistant to erosion and, therefore, form escarpments with prominent ledges. The channel deposits grade laterally into alluvial-fan deposits characterized by lenticular beds of sandstone that exhibit small-scale crossbedding. The alluvial fans grade into loosely to moderately cemented sandstone which may be massive or heavily crossbedded, or may show a nearly horizontal, finely laminar bedding. The lower unit generally is conspicuously unconformable with the underlying Brule formation and in different places is overlain either unconformably or conformably by the upper unit.
The upper unit consists mainly of fine-grained soft to moderately hard generally massive sandstone. A sample of the sandstone was collected at 19-62-lbb3 and the weight percentage by grain size was determined to be clay 4.0; silt, 28.4; very fine sand, 62.0; fine sand, 5.2; medium sand, 0.2; and coarse sand, 0.2. In general, there is very little horizontal bedding and only local small-scale crossbedding; therefore, the massiveness of the upper unit generally is broken only by concretionary layers, pipes, and nodules of well-cemented sandstone and by a few lenticular beds of volcanic ash. The concretions probably were formed by the cementing of sand by calcium carbonate that was deposited by percolating ground water. This phenomenon is discussed more fully by Cady (Wenzel, Cady, and Waite, 1946, p. 73-75). The beds of volcanic ash generally are thickest and most numerous nearer the top of the formation.
In Goshen County the Arikaree formation is cut by several faults and by many fractures. These were probably caused by post-Miocene stresses along faults which were active during the Laramide orogeny, and by regional post-Miocene upwarping of the area. On the west side of the Whalen fault the top of the Brule formation lies in fault contact with beds on the east side that were estimated by Schlaikjer (1935c, p. 121) to be 700 feet higher in the section. There also are several other faults and many fractures and fissures in the northcentral part of the county. (See pi. 1.) Many of these fractures and fissures are open, but some are filled, as indicated by the occurrence of clastic dikes in the area. The dikes are resistant, and where erosion has been active they are prominent features. These dikes also are associated with faults in the area.
Extent and thickness. The Arikaree formation crops out in the upland areas in Goshen County. It is relatively resistant to erosion and generally constitutes the upper part of the Goshen Hole escarpment. In many places erosional outliers are entirely of the Arikaree

GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES 37
formation or are capped by it. In the county, it ranges in thickness from a knife edge to about 1,000 feet.
Water supply. The Arikaree formation yields water to many domestic and stock wells in the county, and to three irrigation wells in the northern part of the county. Owing to the relatively low permeability of the material, a considerable saturated thickness of the formation normally must be penetrated in order to develop a well of large discharge. A well in Niobrara County, Wyo., about 6 miles north of the Goshen County line, reportedly yields 1,000 gpm with a drawdown of 14 feet, or a specific capacity of about 71 gpm for each foot of drawdown. This is a high specific capacity for wells in the Arikaree formation, and indicates that the water probably is coming from fractures. As there appear to be many fractures in the Arikaree in Goshen County, large yields should be available where the fractures can be located by test drilling.
PLIOCENE SERIES
In Goshen County the Pliocene deposits present a complex system of channel deposits that have been isolated, truncated, and obscured, or completely destroyed, by subsequent erosion. A more detailed study of the Pliocene deposits would be needed to.define them accurately. Underlying the conglomeratic cap rock on Pine Ridge is a deposit of sandy siltstone about 60 feet thick that may be of Pliocene age. The coarse channel deposits that occur on several high isolated hills very likely are of Pliocene age, but the age of some of the lower channel deposits which are in the valley of the North Platte Eiver, is very questionable. As they are quite similar to that of the Quaternary deposits of sand and gravel, these lower channel deposits are included with the upland sand and gravel in this report. Only the coarse channel deposits that occur on Pine Eidge, Casebier Hill, and Spoon Butte, and those that occur as isolated remnants on the upland area about 2 miles southeast of Casebier Hill are considered to be Pliocene.
CHANNEL DEPOSITS
The Pliocene channel deposits consist mainly of coarse sand and gravel which in places contain cobbles and medium-sized boulders. The deposits that form the cap rock on Pine Eidge and Casebier Hill are cemented by calcium carbonate into a moderately hard conglomerate that contains boulders ranging from small to medium. Pebbles of volcanic materials (probably rhyolite) were found on both Pine Eidge and Spoon Butte, and a fragment of stream-rounded red scoria was collected in the loose gravel on top of Pine Eidge. The deposits that occur on top of Spoon Butte consist of unconsolidated sand and gravel in which were found fragments of bones and horse teeth.

38 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
The Pliocene channel deposits in Goshen County as herein described probably do not exceed 25 feet in thickness. They are topographically high and are well drained; therefore, they are not a source of water for wells in Goshen County.
QUATERNARY SYSTEM
In the report area the Quaternary deposits include upland deposits, valley fill, dune sand, loesslike deposits, and slope wash. The areal distribution of the loesslike deposits and the slope wash was not mapped because these deposits generally occur only as a thin veneer, although they are present over much of the area. The loesslike deposits of eolian material range in size from silt to medium-grained sand, which indicates that their source is local. The slope wash occurs mainly as a mantle of detritus and rill wash on slopes below escarpments and hills and in bordering lowlands where stream erosion is at a minimum. The slope wash in the area is derived mainly from the Brule and Chadron formations and, therefore, consists mainly of fine-grained materials. Locally, the slope wash is as much as 54 feet thick in the area about 4 miles southwest of Torrington (section C-C*', pi. 1). Neither the loesslike deposits nor the slope wash are an important source of ground water.
PLEISTOCENE SERIES
UPLAND DEPOSITS
The upland deposits, of Pliocene(?) and Pleistocene age, include the deposits of sand and gravel that underlie the upland slopes which border the valley of the North Platte Eiver. The lower boundary of these slopes is indistinct in many places, but it is about 200 feet above the present level of the river. Channel deposits of unconsolidated sand and gravel that probably are of Pliocene age are included with the Quaternary deposits because of their similarity to the younger deposits. The upland deposits consists of remnants of terrace deposits, pediment deposits, and the residuum from conglomerates especially of the basal channel conglomerate of the Arikaree formation.
In the area about half a mile north of the town of Lingle the upland deposits form a conspicuous ridge. The origin of this deposit of sand and gravel is debatable, but probably is due to multiple conditions that include deposition by streams, accumulation of detritus, and disintegration of nearby rock. If the original pediment slope from the base of Pine Ridge, which lies about 5 miles to the northwest, is projected outward from the ridge, this deposit can be correlated with the gravels that underlie remnants of the pediment. However, because the deposit lies in the valley of the North Platte River within the limits of the level of the third terrace, it includes some river deposits. These up-

GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES 39
land deposits are topographically high and are largely drained and thus do not serve as an aquifer.
Test drilling in the valley of the North Platte Kiver revealed several channel deposits of sand and gravel, the tops of which are about 200-450 feet above the level of the North Platte Kiver. The extent of these channels is shown by bedrock contours (pi. 2), and their thickness is shown by cross sections (pi. 1). These thick channel deposits would yield adequate supplies of water to wells for irrigation if a sufficient saturated thickness were penetrated. The saturated thickness of these materials is shown on plate 3.
Many other upland deposits of sand and gravel are present in the county. These are mainly in the form of a thin veneer or occur in patches; usually they are topographically high and, therefore, well drained. They serve mainly as infiltration areas for recharge of underlying beds from precipitation.
PLEISTOCENE AND RECENT SERIES
VALLEY FILL
The valley fill of Pleistocene and Recent age occurs along the inner valley of the North Platte River and its tributaries. The fill consists mainly of highly permeable sand and gravel, and its deposition and distribution are described on pages 16-17. As shown by the contours of the bedrock surface (pi. 3) and by the cross sections (pi. 2), deep gravel-filled channels underlie the axial part of the stream valleys and the broad third terrace north of the river. The valley fill consists of the following depositional units: Those of the third terrace, the second terrace, the first terrace, and the flood plain (the latter two being mapped together).
Deposits of the third terrace. For the purposes of this report only the third-terrace deposits that underlie the relatively flat area approximately between the Torrington canal on the south and the Interstate canal on the north and between Rawhide Creek on the west and the State line on the east are of sufficient extent and thickness to warrant describing in detail. The underlying deposits of sand and gravel occur as fill in channels that were cut by Rawhide Creek; therefore, owing to the irregular pattern of these channels, the thickness of the deposits ranges from a knife edge to about 210 feet.
The permeable third-terrace deposits constitute an important aquifer in that they yield water to many wells, a large number of which are used for irrigation, and they are recharged freely from surface water (canals and laterals, intermittent streams, and irrigated lands) and from precipitation. Generally, the saturated thickness of the material is sufficient for the development of large supplies of water, but in some places there is little or no saturated material because of the

40 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
presence of buried ridges of bedrock which separate former channels of Kawhide Creek. (See pi. 3.) The most notable of these ridges is the one that underlies the area about l1/^ miles north of Torrington.
Deposits of the second terrace. The second terrace is a comparatively minor feature along the valley of the North Platte Kiver, in that it is poorly preserved and occurs in narrow isolated patches. The largest remnant of this terrace occurs as a narrow strip between U. S. Highway 26 and the Interstate canal from about the center of K. 63 W. to about the center of K. 64 W. In test hole 25-63-3bb a thickness of 210 feet of deposits was penetrated beneath the second terrace before bedrock was struck. No attempt has been made to develop wells of large discharge in these second-terrace deposits, but wells of moderate to large yield probably could be developed in places. The secondterrace deposits are recharged freely from irrigation water and from precipitation.
Flood-plain deposits. The flood plain as described and mapped in this report includes both the present flood plain and the next previous flood plain or first terrace, as the boundary between the two is indistinct and poorly defined and because the first terrace is reported to have been inundated by the North Platte River during periods of extremely high floods. The deposits that underlie the flood plain of the valley of the North Platte River consist mainly of sand and gravel that contain lenses and beds of fine sand, silt, and clay, large chunks of siltstone, lenses of siltstone pebbles, and cobbles and boulders. The greatest thickness of flood-plain deposits found along the North Platte River valley was 197 feet in test hole 24-61-15bd. The maximum thickness of these deposits beneath the flood plain of Rawhide Creek was reported to be 160 feet in a shot hole in sec. 15, T. 26 N., R. 62 W. The maximum thickness along Horse and Bear Creeks was about 45 feet in the vicinity of Lagrange. The flood-plain deposits of Rawhide Creek valley consist mainly of fine- to medium-grained sand that contains silt and gravel. These materials for the most part are fine grained, as they were derived mainly from local outcrops of the Arikaree and Brule formations. The deposits that underlie the valleys of Horse and Bear Creeks consist mainly of fine- to medium-grained sand admixed with silt, clay, and some gravel. However, in the vicinity of Lagrange, the deposits contain much sand and gravel.
Along the Laramie River and the North Platte River in the western part of the county, the flood-plain deposits are quite narrow. East of the town of Lingle, the flood plain widens to as much as 3 miles. The flood-plain deposits along Rawhide Creek are about 1 to 2 miles wide. These deposits are about 51/£ miles wide along Horse and Bear Creeks in the vicinity of Lagrange. They also

GROUND WATER

41

occur along Horse Creek north, of Lagrange but, because they are relatively thin and narrow, they were not mapped.
Many wells .in the area obtain water from the flood-plain deposits. These deposits are by far the most productive aquifer in the county, and yield water to many domestic and stock wells and to most of the irrigation, municipal, and industrial wells. Wells that yield more than 3,000 gpm have been developed in this aquifer in the valley of the North Platte R.iver.
Dune sand. Dune sand covers a considerable part of the area in much the same manner as the loesslike deposits that were previously described, and in many places the two deposits are admixed. Only the more extensive areas of dune sand are shown on plate 1. The largest deposit of dune sand is in the area north and east of Torrington, where the sand deposits extend from the level of the flood plain to above the level of the third terrace of the North Platte River. Another large deposit of dune sand occurs in the northeastern part of the county, where a thick deposit composes Lone Sand Hill and covers much of the adjacent area.
The dune sand generally lies above the water table and is not known to yield water to wells. It does, however, serve as an excellent medium for infiltration of water from precipitation and from streams and canals, and for recharge of underlying materials.

GROUND WATER
PRINCIPLES OF OCCURRENCE
The fundamental principles governing the occurrence and movement of ground water has been set forth in detail by Meinzer (1923a) and many others. Only a brief discussion of the subject will be made here.
Ground water in Goshen County is derived chiefly from the infiltration of irrigation water and from precipitation that falls as rain or snow. A part of this water runs off directly into streams, a part evaporates, a part is consumed by vegetation, and a part percolates through pore spaces in the soil and underlying rocks to the water table where it enters the zone of saturation. Some of the water in the zone of saturation eventually returns to the surface through seeps and springs or is discharged by wells and evapotranspiration. Most of the water, however, percolates directly and invisibly into surface streams.
The porous rocks below the water table generally are saturated. Those that are sufficiently permeable to do so, yield water to wells. In the more permeable rocks, such as the deposits of unconsolidated sand and gravel, the individual pores are interconnected and are large enough so that the water moves freely through them under the force

42 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.

of gravity, but in less permeable rocks, such as the siltstone and clay of some of the bedrock formations, the pores are so small that water moves through them slowly.

PHYSICAL AND HYDROLOGKEC PROPERTIES OF WATER-BEARING MATERIALS
The quantity of water that a rock formation will yield to wells and the ability of the formation to transmit water depend upon the physical and hydrologic properties of the materials that constitute the formation. Detailed geologic descriptions of materials that are discovered in drilling, such as those included in the logs at the end of this report, are useful in determining the hydrologic properties of the rock formations, but more accurate quantitative estimates require a more comprehensive analysis of the materials by means of laboratory or field tests.
Twenty-one samples of the bedrock formations were analyzed in the hydrologic laboratory to determine their physical and hydrologic properties. These studies included particle-size analyses and determinations of apparent specific gravity, porosity, moisture equivalent, specific yield, and coefficient of permeability. Particle-size analyses were made for all 21 of the samples collected, but other physical values were determined only for 15 of them. The results of the laboratory studies for these 15 samples are summarized in table 1, and the 21 particle-size analyses are given on pages 28-33.
Pumping tests were made at four wells that tap the flood-plain deposits and at two wells that tap the third-terrace deposits. From these tests determinations of transmissibility, permeability, and storage coefficients were made. Pumping tests were made whenever possible because they allow an analysis of the water-bearing materials under natural conditions.

IjABORATORY DETERMINATIONS
Grain size. A. particle-size analysis, or mechanical analysis, of granular material consists of separating into groups the grains of different sizes and determining the percentage, by weight, of the total sample each size group constitutes. Grain sizes larger than 0.0625 millimeter were determined by wet-sieve analysis and sizes smaller than 0.0625 millimeter were determined by the hydrometer method of wet analysis. The results of the particle-size analyses of the materials are given on pages 28-33.
Porosity. The porosity of a rock aggregate is its property of containing interstices without regard to size, shape, or arrangement of openings. Porosity is expressed quantitatively as the percentage of the total volume of a rock that is occupied by interstices. In a rock that is saturated with water, the porosity is the percentage of the total volume of rock that is occupied by water. The porosity of a rock indicates only the amount of water the rock can hold, not the amount it can yield to wells. Some rocks, such as clay and silt, may have a high porosity but will yield very little water to wells.
The porosity of some of the samples studied was determined as a step in the calculation of the specific yield. The porosities of the samples given in table 1 ranged from 7.4 to 46.6 percent by volume. In general the larger porosities occur in the finer grained rocks, so long as they are unconsolidated or only partially consolidated.
Moisture equivalent, specific retention, and specific yield. The moisture equivalent of a water-bearing material is the ratio of (1) the weight of water that the material, after saturation, will retain against a centrifugal force that is 1,000 times the force of gravity to (2) the weight of the dry material. The moisture equivalent by volume is computed by multiplying the moisture equivalent by weight by the apparent specific gravity of the material. The specific retention that is, the quantity of water that a material will retain against the pull of gravity if it is drained after having been saturated is expressed as the ratio of the retained water to the total volume of material. It is determined by adjusting the moisture equivalent by volume by a correction factor that was calculated by Piper (1933, p. 481-487). Because the moisture equivalent is significant only as a means of determining the specific retention, only the specific retention is listed in table 1.
The specific yield of a water-bearing material is defined as the ratio of the volume of water that a saturated aquifer will yield by gravity to its own volume, and is numerically equal to the porosity minus the specific retention. The specific yield of the samples ranged from 1.4 to 32.5 percent. A fine-grained saturated material will yield its water slowly; the rate of draining is somewhat proportional to the permeability of the material. Owing to their fine-grained texture, the bedrock

44 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
formations yield water slowly, and the values for specific yield that were calculated in the laboratory probably would not be reached in field tests under natural conditions until several months had passed.
Permeability. The permeability of a formation generally is expressed as the coefficient of permeability, which as used in the Geological Survey is the Meinzer unit (meinzer) the number of gallons of water a day, at 60°F, that is conducted laterally through each mile of the water-bearing bed under investigation (measured at right angles to the direction of flow), for each foot of saturated thickness of the bed, and for each foot per mile of hydraulic gradient. The field coefficient of permeability is the same unit, except that it is measured at the prevailing field temperature of the ground water rather than at 60 °F. The coefficient of transmissibility may be expressed as the number of gallons of water a day, at the prevailing temperature, transmitted through each mile strip extending the saturated thickness of the aquifer under a hydraulic gradient of 1 foot to the mile; hence, it is the product of the average field coefficient of permeability and the saturated thickness of the aquifer.
The coefficient of permeability of 11 samples of the bedrock formations was determined with a constant-head permeameter. Laboratory methods employed in determining permeability have been described by V. C. Fishel (Wenzel, 1942, p. 59-68). Five of the samples transmitted no water during the time of the tests and the permeability is recorded as negligible. The coefficients of permeability determined by the laboratory tests for the bedrock formations generally were very low, ranging from a negligible amount to 6 gpd (gallons per day) per square foot in 9 of the samples. The other 2 had permeabilities of 69 and 335 gpd per square foot, respectively (table 1).
PUMPING-TEST DETERMINATIONS OF TRANSMISSIBrLITY,
PERMEABILITY, AND STORAGE COEFFICIENTS
Six pumping tests were made to determine the coefficients of transmissibility and storage 3 of the unconsolidated deposits of sand and
8 The coefficient of storage of an aquifer is the volume of water it releases from or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in the component of head normal to that surface.
A simple way of visualizing this concept is to imagine an artesian aquifer which is elastic and is uniform in thickness, and which is assumed, for convenience, to be horizontal. If the head of water in that aquifer is decreased there will be released from storage some finite volume of water that is proportional to the change in head. Because the aquifer is horizontal, the full observed head change is evidently effective perpendicular to the aquifer surface. Imagine further a representative prism extending vertically from the top to the bottom of this aquifer, and extending laterally so that its cross-sectional area is coextensive with the aquifer-surface area over which the head change occurs. The volume of water released from storage in that prism, divided by the product of the prism's cross-sectional area and the change in head, results in a dimensionless number which is the coefficient of storage. If this example were revised slightly, it could be used to demonstrate the same concept of coefficient of storage for a horizontal water-table aquifer or for a situation in which the head of water in the aquifer is increased.

gravel composing the valley fill. The field coefficients of permeability were determined by dividing the coefficient of transmissibility by the saturated thickness of the material. The results of these tests, which were obtained by means of the Theis method (Theis, 1935, p. 519-524) are shown in table 2.

During each of three of the tests, a test well was pumped at a constant rate for at least 24 hours and periodic measurements were made of the drawdown in three observation wells at different distances from the test well. The transmissibility and storage coefficients were computed for each of these tests. Because the pumped wells penetrated the aquifer only partially, the drawdown in the observation well nearest the pumped well in each of the tests was somewhat greater than it would have been if the pumped well had fully penetrated the aquifer. Also, in each of the tests the drawdown in the observation well farthest from the pumped well was small, and the effects of the errors caused by extraneous influences were larger than in the nearer observation wells. Therefore, although there is substantial agreement between the results computed for the three observation wells in each test, only the result computed for the middle observation well is listed in the table for each of the three tests. Because insufficient data were collected during the other three tests, it was not possible to compute the value of the coefficient of storage, and only the value of transmissibility is listed.
The field coefficient of permeability computed for the flood-plain deposits ranged from 1,500 to 8,700 gpd per square foot; and that computed for the third-terrace deposits ranged from 2,300 to 5,900

46 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
gpd per square foot. The storage coefficient computed for the floodplain deposits was 0.235 (two tests) and that computed for the thirdterrace deposits was 0.216.
INTERFERENCE BETWEEN WELLS
In areas where wells of large discharge are closely spaced, the cones of depression around the wells may overlap sufficiently (interfere) to cause a substantial increase of the pumping lift. The amount of interference depends upon the distance between wells, the rate and duration of pumping of the wells, and the hydrologic properties of the aquifer.
As soon as a pump begins discharging water from a well under water-table conditions, the water table in the vicinity of the well is lowered, and a hydraulic gradient toward the well is established. The water table assumes a form comparable to that of an inverted cone, with the well at the apex of the cone. At the beginning, most of the water that is pumped from the well is obtained by dewatering materials close to the well. As pumping is continued, the material near the well is gradually dewatered; a hydraulic gradient is established that allows approximately the amount of water that is being pumped to be transmitted to the well; and the water is derived from ever increasing distances from the well. Thus, the cone of depression continues to expand, and the water table within the cone continues to decline gradually. The development of the cone may be altered if water is added to the formations by natural or artificial recharge, or if the expanding cone reaches less permeable rocks which form barriers to the movement of water. After the pumping of a well is stopped, water continued to percolate toward the well for a time because the hydraulic gradient is still in that direction; the water gradually fills the well and the adjacent material that was dewatered by pumping. As the material near the well is being refilled, the hydraulic gradient decreases, and the recovery of the water level in the well becomes progressively slower. A general equalization of water levels eventually takes place over the affected area, and the water table tends to assume its original form, although it may remain temporarily or permanently lower than before water was withdrawn, depending on recharge.
The drawdown in the vicinity of a discharging well decreases with an increase in distance from the well, and increases with an increase in the rate and duration of pumping. For example, test well 24r-61-5cb, which was pumped at a rate of 1,060 gpm, after 25 hours produced drawdowns of 0.83 foot at 159 feet, 0.50 foot at 300 feet, and 0.33 foot at 500 feet. After the 25-hour period of pumping the computed radius of influence of the cone of depression was about 900 feet.

SPECIFIC CAPACITY OF WELLS
The specific capacity of a well, or yield per unit of drawdown, is expressed as the number of gallons per minute that a well yields for each foot of drawdown of the water level in the well. Under watertable conditions, this relation is approximately constant only when the drawdown is but a small fraction of the saturated thickness of the aquifer. The drawdown depends also upon the differences in the construction and development of wells. However, a comparison of specific capacities is useful in estimating the permeability of aquifers and the relative efficiency of wells. The discharge and drawdown of many of the wells are given in table 7.
The highest specific capacities in Goshen County are in wells in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits. Data for 35 wells of large discharge in the sand and gravel deposits of the valley fill of the North Platte Kiver indicate that the specific capacities for these wells range from 21 to 250 gpm per foot of drawdown and average about 120 gpm per foot of drawdown. The wide range in specific capacities is due largely to the differences in the composition of the aquifer but partly to differences in construction and development of the wells. Two irrigation wells in the alluvium in the vicinity of Lagrange have specific capacities of 16.6 and 40 gpm per foot of drawdown, respectively. In the same vicinity an irrigation well that produces water from the alluvium and from fractures in the Brule formation has a specific capacity of 25 gpm per foot of drawdown.
Wells in the bedrock formations generally could be expected to have much lower specific capacities than the wells in the unconsolidated materials. Well 29-63-14de, which is in the Arikaree formation, has a specific capacity of about 12 gpm per foot of drawdown. Well 29-63-6bd., which produces from both the Arikaree formation and the alluvium, has a specific capacity of about 17 gpm per foot of drawdown. The specific capacity of two wells in the Lance formation, 23-62-34cd and 25-63-25bd, is 1.5 and 0.20 gpm per foot of drawdown, respectively.
THE WATER TABLE
The water table is defined as the upper surface of the zone of saturation except where that surface is formed by an impermeable body (Meinzer, 1923b, p. 22). Where the aquifer is overlain by a bed that is impermeable or that is of low permeability the aquifer is artesian and a piezometric surface exists. The piezometric surface is an imaginary surface that everywhere coincides with the static level of the water in the aquifer; therefore, it is the surface to which the water from a given aquifer will rise under its full head. If the piezometric surface is above the land surface, water will flow from wells that tap the aquifer. In Goshen County both water-table and artesian conditions exist, but, as they are not coincident, only measurements of water-

48 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
table wells were used in compiling the water-table contour map (pi. 1} and the depth-to-water map (pi. 4). For this reason no contours are shown in the central and east-central parts of the county, where most of the wells have tapped water under artesian pressure.
SHAPE AND SLOPS OP THE WATER TABUE
The water table in general is not level or uniform but is a warped, sloping surface. Irregularities in the amount and direction of slope are caused by differences in thickness or permeability of the aquifer and by unequal additions or withdrawals of water. Ground water moves in the general direction of the slope of the water table, and the rate of movement, assuming a uniform cross section, is proportional to the slope (hydraulic gradient) and the permeability of the water-bearing material. The configuration of the water table is shown by contours, which are lines along which all points have the same altitude. The direction of ground-water movement is at a right angle to the contour lines. The central part of the water-table contour map (pi. 1) is based on water-level measurements made during the spring of 1951. The water-level measurements used in constructing the contours in the upland areas were made during the period 1943-51. As there was no appreciable change in the water levels in the upland areas during this period, it was not necessary to adjust these measurements to conform with the water-level measurements made during the spring of 1951.
In the North Platte River valley and adjoining upland areas the water table in the valley fill, the upland deposits, and the Brule and Arikaree formations is continuous. The water table generally slopes toward the river -and its principal tributaries in a downstream direction.
In the area that is underlain by the Lance and Chadron formations,, a water table generally exists in the weathered zone or overlying slope-wash material. In the irrigated part of the area that is underlain by these formations, usually part of the weathered zone and overlying slope wash is saturated and the water table conforms closely to the topography of the land surface. The water-table contour lines were not extended into this area, as there were too few water-table wells for adequate control.
Inasmuch as the slope of the water table is dependent on the permeability and thickness of the water-bearing materials and on the amount of water being transmitted, the slope is considerably different in the various formations. Although a large amount of water is transmitted through the unconsolidated material of the valley fill and upland deposits, the deposits are so permeable that the water table i& nearly flat, the average gradient being only about 15 feet to the mile. The slope of the water table in the less permeable Brule and Arikaree

GROUND WATER

49

formations is much greater and generally ranges from about 45 feet to about 140 feet to the mile. However, the water table along the escarpments may slope as much as 400 feet to the mile. The slope of the water table in the Brule formation is affected largely by the extent to which the formation is fractured. In places where there has been little fracturing the slope of the water table is very steep, whereas in the more highly fractured areas the gradient is less. The slope of the water table in the Arikaree formation is about the same as that in the Brule formation.

DEPTH TO WATER
The depth to the water table in the area generally is determined largely by the configuration of the land surface. In general, the depth to water is greatest where the land surface is high and least where the land surface is low.
The depth to water in the area is shown on plate 4. The lines indicate areas where the depth to water is less than 50 feet, 50 to 100 feet, 100 to 200 feet, 200 to 300 feet, and more than 300 feet. In the bottom land along the major streams and in much of the irrigated area south of the North Platte Eiver the water table is so shallow that the capillary fringe extends to the surface or to the root zone of the vegetation. Areas of high evapotranspiration, in which the depth to water generally is less than 10 feet, also are shown on plate 4. The depth to water in the flood-plain deposits generally is less than 5Q feet, and in the third-terrace deposits it generally is less than 80 feet. The greater depths to water occur in the upland areas. In the vicinity of Pine Eidge and in the northern part of the county, in the divide area between the drainages of Eawhide Creek and a tributary of the Niobrara Eiver, the depth to water exceeds 300 feet.

FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WATER TABUE
The water table is not a stationary surface but fluctuates up or down as water is added to or withdrawn from the underground reservoir. The stage of the water table indicates the quantity of water in storage in the ground-water reservoir in much the same manner as the water level in a surface reservoir indicates the amount of water in storage in the reservoir. Thus, water-level fluctuations indicate the changes in storage that result from recharge to or discharge from the groundwater reservoir during a given period. In much of the area the water table fluctuates noticeably in response to rather large changes in the rates of recharge or discharge. In the upland area, however, the recharge-discharge relationship is more or less in balance and the water table fluctuates within a very narrow range. (See hydrograph of well 29-61-26cb in fig. 5.) In Goshen County, recharge is contributed mainly by precipitation and irrigation seepage, and the discharge is

due to the withdrawal of water by natural drainage, by evapotranspiration, and by pumping from wells. The graphs of the three wells adjacent to irrigated areas show water-level fluctuations caused by recharge, precipitation, and irrigation, and discharge by evapotranspiration.
In order to observe the fluctuations of the water table in the area, 65 wells were selected for periodic measurement of the water level. These measurements have been published in annual water-level reports (U. S. Geol. Survey, 1946-50,1954-56).
Fluctuations caused ~by irrigation. In the irrigated areas that are underlain by valley nil, fluctuations of the water table are caused principally by seepage from canals and laterals and from irrigated fields. In general, the water table rises during the irrigation season and falls during the rest of the year.
The hydrograph of the average depth to water in 12 wells in the valley of the North Platte River (fig. 6) shows that, in the part of the

52 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
irrigated area underlain by the valley fill, the decline of the water table is checked as soon as irrigation water is applied to the land. After a few weeks the recharge from irrigation is sufficient to overbalance the natural discharge and cause the water table to rise. The water table usually begins to rise in April or May and continues to rise until about the end of September, when irrigation is discontinued or greatly reduced. The water table then declines from the seasonal high in September until irrigation begins again in April or May of the next year. The water table rises about 5 feet during the irrigation season and declines approximately the same amount during the subsequent nonirrigation season. Most of the rise is caused by seepage from canals and irrigated fields, although possibly a small amount may be due to precipitation during April, May, and June.
The rise of water levels does not reflect the entire magnitude of the seepage losses, because discharge from the ground-water reservoir continues throughout the period of rising water level; the rise indicates only the extent to which the recharge exceeds the discharge. If the downward trend of the hydrograph during the winter is projected until the time when the water levels actually reached the seasonal high, the gross average rise of water level that would have occurred if the winter net rate of discharge had continued through the summer was 8.2, 7.6, and 8.0 feet for 1949,1950, and 1951, respectively, or an average of 7.9 feet for the 3 years of record (fig. 6). Because of greater loss from evaporation and transpiration and because the hydraulic gradient is steeper, the discharge from the ground-water reservoir increases during the summer. Consequently, projected declines shown in figure 6 probably should be slightly steeper and the gross average Irise in water levels probably would be slightly higher than the indicated 7.9 feet
In the areas underlain by the relatively impermeable bedrock formations, the fluctuations caused by seepage from the canals and latr erals are as much as 25 feet in some places. The greatest fluctuations occur near canals that are normally high above the water table. Owing to the low permeability of the bedrock formations, the rise of the water table in places is great enough to bring the water table in contact with the bottom of the canal.
The fluctuations caused by seepage from irrigation water that is applied to the land are relatively small compared to fluctuations caused by seepage from canals. During an application of irrigation water the water table may rise as much as 4 feet, but this rise is usually followed by a decline that is due to transpiration by plants; the decline continues until the beginning of the next application of irrigation water. Fluctuations caused by the application of irrigation water in areas underlain by relatively impermeable bedrock formations are shown by hydrographs of wells 25-62-27acl, 24-62-27db, and 24-

GROUND WATER

53

62-28dd in figure 5. These hydrographs are more fully described in the following discussion of fluctuations caused by evapotranspiration.
Fluctuations caused by precipitation. In the irrigated area under-
lain by alluvium and terrace sand and gravel, the amount of recharge to the water table from precipitation is so small in comparison to the recharge from irrigation that it has no appreciable effect on the water table. In the areas underlain by the relatively impermeable bedrock formations, the water table may rise 1 to 3 feet, or even more in places, owing to recharge from precipitation in the spring before the beginning of irrigation. This is shown by the hydrograph of wells in figure 5.
Fluctuations caused by evapotranspiration. In areas where the capillary fringe extends to the land surface or into the root zone of the vegetation, ground water is discharged by evapotranspiration. In the area of high evapotranspiration along the North Platte River, discharge of ground water by evapotranspiration causes very little seasonal lowering of the water table. Although the rate of discharge of ground water is large during the growing season, much of the water discharged by evapotranspiration is rapidly replaced by ground water that moves in through the highly permeable sand and gravel.
In the areas of shallow water table that are underlain by impermeable bedrock evapotranspiration greatly affects the level of the water table during the growing season. The hydrographs in figure 5 show how the water table is affected by transpiration of plants. Hydrographs of wells 24-62-27acl and 24-62-27db, at the edge of a sugarbeet field, show the rise of the water level that was caused by the application of water to the field and the decline of the water level that was caused by evaporation and by transpiration by the beets. The beet field is in a poorly drained area where the slope wash is underlain by the Chadron formation. As a result of precipitation, water levels begin to rise in the late winter and continue to rise until June. By June, the rate of discharge of ground water by evapotranspiration is sufficient to overbalance the recharge due to precipitation and the water level begins to decline. This decline continues until the beet fields are irrigated, usually at the beginning of July, when the water levels begin to rise again.- By the end of July 1949 the discharge of water by evapotranspiration was sufficient to overbalance the recharge from irrigation and precipitation, and the water level began to decline. By this time, the sugar beets had become quite large and were consuming a large amount of water. In the growing season of 1950, which was unusually cold and consequently was poor for crop production, the water level continued to rise during the entire irrigation season, and only minor declines were caused by evapotranspiration. After the end of the irrigation season, the water level declined owing to sevapotranspiration.

54 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
The hydrograph of well 24-62-28dd, which is adjacent to an alfalfa field, shows a rise of the water table due to precipitation in the spring. The water table begins to decline as soon as the plants start growing later in the spring and continues to decline during most of the time that irrigation water is applied to the land. When the alfalfa is cut, the transpiration rate is greatly reduced and the water level rises rapidly as the result of the next irrigation that follows the cutting. As the alfalfa grows again, the transpiration rate increases and eventually overbalances the recharge from irrigation and thus again causes a decline of the water level. The hydrograph shows the effects of two cuttings of alfalfa during the 1949 irrigation season. The third cutting was in the fall after the irrigation season and had little effect on the water table.
Fluctuations caused by drainage. In the areas underlain by the more permeable materials, the chief cause of decline of the water table is the discharge of ground water into streams and drains; the water level falls until the rate of discharge declines to the rate of recharge. This is illustrated in figure 6, which includes a hydrograph of the average water level in 12 wells in the valley fill. The water table declines steadily between September and April, during which time little or no recharge from irrigation takes place. In figure 6, the columns at the bottom of the graph show the invisible pickup of the North Platte River the amount of water draining from the valley fill in the stretch between the gaging stations at Whalen Dam and the Wyoming-Nebraska State line.
In most areas underlain by the relatively impermeable bedrock formations the decline of the water table due to drainage is small.
RECHARGE
Recharge is the term used to denote the addition of water to the ground-water reservoir, and it may be accomplished in several ways* Once the water becomes a part of the ground-water body it moves in the direction of the slope of the water table, later to be discharged at some point down gradient.
In nature a ground-water reservoir as a hydraulic system is in balance ; over a long period of years the recharge is equal to the discharge and the water table is more or less fixed in position within seasonal limits. Discharge by wells is a new discharge superimposed on the previous system. Before a new equilibrium can be established, water levels must fall throughout the aquifer to an extent sufficient to increase the natural recharge or decrease the natural discharge or both, by an amount equal to the amount being discharged by the wells. Until this new equilibrium is established, water must be withdrawn from storage in the aquifer, and, conversely, the new equilibrium can-

GROUND WATER

55

not be established until the amount of water that is withdrawn from storage by wells is sufficient to depress the water table enough to change the recharge or natural discharge, or both, by the proper amount. These are the fundamental laws upon which must be based all investigations to determine the potential perennial yield or socalled safe yield of aquifers.
For the purpose of discussing recharge, Goshen County is separated into two areas: the nonirrigated area and the irrigated area.

NONIRRIGATED AREA
In the nonirrigated area seepage from precipitation that occurs as rain or snow is the principal source of recharge. Under favorable conditions of soil moisture a part of the precipitation seeps down through the soil and is added to the ground-water reservoir. The average annual precipitation in the area is about 14 inches, of which possibly not more than 5 percent percolates to the ground-water reservoir. Most of the water that is recharged moves toward the North Platte Kiver or its tributaries.

IRRIGATED AREA
In the part of the irrigated area that is underlain by the permeable sand and gravel of the valley fill, recharge by seepage from precipitation is small in comparison to the amount of recharge from irrigation water, as is demonstrated by the large fluctuation of the water table caused by the application of irrigation water. However, in the irrigated areas underlain by fine-grained slope-wash material, the water table is near the surface and consequently the small amount of precipitation that percolates to the ground-water reservoir causes an appreciable rise of the water table.
In the valleys of Horse and Bear Creeks the ground-water reservoir is recharged mainly by seepage from irrigation and to a minor extent by seepage from precipitation. It is estimated that about half of the water diverted for irrigation in the valley of Horse and Bear Creeks is recharged to the ground-water reservoir. The remainder of the irrigated land lies in the North Platte project area, which consists of that part of the valley of the North Platte River that lies between the Interstate and Fort Laramie canals. In this area sufficient information was obtainable to make quantitative estimates of the recharge to the reservoir.

NORTH PLATTE PROJECT AREA
In the North Platte project area, the recharge to the groundwater reservoir is derived from seepage from irrigation canals and irrigated lands, from subsurface inflow, and from precipitation. No attempt was made to estimate the amount of recharge by seepage

56 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
from precipitation, but it is small in comparison to recharge from other sources.
SEEPAGE FROM IRRIGATION CANALS AND IRRIGATED LANDS
About 202,000 acre-feet of water is estimated to be recharged to the ground-water reservoir each year by seepage from canals and from canal water used to irrigate land. This estimate is made on the assumption that practically all the water lost from the canals and lateral systems is recharged to the ground-water reservoir. The evapotranspiration losses along the canals and lateral systems were considered to be negligible.
For the purpose of this study the irrigated area was divided into the following three parts, according to the source of irrigationwater supply: The area supplied by the Interstate canal, the area supplied by small diversions from the North Platte River, and the area supplied by the Fort Laramie canal.
Interstate canal. The Interstate canal starts at Whalen Dam and carries water from the North Platte River to the irrigated lands on the north side of the river. Some water is delivered to the Lingle Water Users Association and to the Hill Lateral District; however, most of the water goes to the Pathfinder Irrigation District. The distribution system consists mostly of canals and ditches excavated in the valley fill.
The amount of seepage from the 50.8-mile stretch of the Interstate canal that lies within Goshen County was determined by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation (1949) to be about 13 percent of the water that is diverted from the North Platte River. The average annual diversion from the river for the 4-year period 1948-51, inclusive, was 542,000 acre-feet, and the average annual seepage from the canal thus is estimated to have been about 70,000 acre-feet. No attempt was made to distinguish between seepage from the laterals and that from irrigated fields as factors in recharge to the groundwater reservoir. However, about half the diverted water is estimated to have recharged the ground-water reservoir. The average annual diversion from the canal .into the lateral system is about 66,000 acre-feet; therefore, the annual recharge to the ground-water reservoir from that source is estimated to be about 33,000 acre-feet. Thus the total recharge derived directly and indirectly from the Interstate canal is estimated to be 103,000 acre-feet per year.
Small diversions. Many small canals divert water from the North Platte River between Whalen Dam and the Wyoming-Nebraska State line. These canals from west to east are as follows: Burbank, Lucerne, Grattan, Rock Ranch, Torrington, North Platte, Narrows, Pratt-Ferris, French, and Mitchell-Gering. These canals and their lateral distribution systems are cut in the valley fill.

GROUND WATER

57

Eecords are kept only of the amount of water that is diverted from the river by the canals, and the estimates of seepage losses from these canals about one-third of the water that is diverted from the river is a composite of estimates made by the men who are responsible for the operation of each of these canals. In addition, an estimated one-fourth of the water applied to the irrigated fields seeps to the water table. Therefore, about half the total amount of water diverted into the small canals is recharged to the water table. As the average amount of water diverted into these small canals is about 58,000 acre-feet per year, the resulting recharge is estimated to be about 29,000 acre-feet per year.
Fort Laramie canal. Water is diverted from the North Platte Eiver into the Fort Laramie canal at Whalen Dam to supply the Goshen Irrigation District in Wyoming, a power-generating station south of Lingle, Wyo., and the Gering and Fort Laramie Irrigation District in Nebraska. According to records kept by the Goshen Irrigation District, the average annual loss of water from the canal and lateral system for the period 1948-51 was 64,000 acre-feet. This loss includes a large amount of water that was delivered to the farmers but not charged to them, and it is therefore considerably in excess of the amount of water lost by seepage.
In the Goshen Irrigation District most of the irrigated land is underlain by relatively impermeable bedrock covered by a mantle of fine-grained slope wash. Consequently, the irrigated land is poorly drained and the water table is maintained near the surface. Owing to these conditions, smaller quantities of irrigation water are required than in the rest of the area. Most of the irrigation water that percolates to the water table is subsequently used by plants, and, consequently, net recharge to the ground water reservoir is negligible.
The small part of the Goshen Irrigation District that is underlain by permeable sand and gravel is well drained; consequently, water seeping from the irrigated land moves away from the area of application. No estimate was made of the amount of water transmitted; however, this may be compensated for by an excess in the total given for the overall recharge to the water table from losses from the canal and lateral system.
The seepage loss from the Fort Laramie canal from water delivered to the Lingle power station is assumed, for administrative purposes, to be 6 percent of the water discharged through the power station. The average discharge through the powerplant for the years 1948-51 was 105,370 acre-feet a year and the average annual loss, on the assumed basis, was about 6,000 acre-feet per year. Thus the total recharge derived directly and indirectly from the Fort Laramie canal is estimated to be 70,000 acre-feet per year.

58 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
SUBSURFACE INFLOW
About 6,000 acre-feet of ground water per year moves through the valley fill of the valleys of the North Platte Kiver and the Laramie Kiver in a downvalley direction and enters the project area. (In the vicinity of the section chosen for estimation, on the line between Ks. 64 and 65 W., the valley fill consists mostly of flood-plain deposits.) Ground water moves into the project area also through the valley fill of Kawhide Creek and of Horse and Bear Creeks; however, this amount is small owing to the low transmissibility of the alluvium in these valleys. The total recharge to the area by subsurface inflow through the valley fill is small in comparison to recharge from other sources.
An estimate of the amount of ground water that enters the area through the valley fill of the North Platte and Laramie Rivers was made by the application of Darcy's law
in which Q quantity of water passing a valley cross section, in gallons per day ;
P= field coefficient or permeability (as defined on page 44) ; I hydraulic gradient of the water table, in feet per mile; and A = cross-sectional area of the saturated part of the allu-
vium, in mile-feet.
The average field coefficient of permeability of the flood-plain deposits was determined from four pumping tests to be about 4,500 gpd per mile-foot for each foot per mile of gradient at the prevailing water temperature, and was used in computing the underflow for both valleys. The cross-sectional area of the saturated part of the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River valley at the line between Rs. 64 and 65 W. is about 75 mile-feet, and the downvalley gradient of the water table is about 10 feet per mile; thus about 3,500 to 4,000 acre-feet of water enters the area each year through the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River valley. The crosssectional area of the saturated part of the flood-plain deposits of the Laramie River valley also is about 75 mile-feet, and the downvalley gradient of the water table is about 6 feet per mile ; thus about 2,000 to 2,500 acre-feet of water enters the area each year through the floodplain deposits of the Laramie River valley.
A large but unknown amount of ground water enters the North Platte project area by subsurface inflow through the bedrock formations. The amount of this recharge was not determined because of the variability in the permeability and thickness of these formations and because of the difficulty in determining these factors. However, it is lumped with recharge from precipitation, and all the errors of

the .analysis, in the storage equation for the North Platte project area on page 65.
DISCHARGE
Ground water is discharged from the area by flow into streams and drains, evapotranspiration, underflow, and pumping from wells. The rate at which it is discharged varies with many factors, such as the depth to the water table, the nature of the vegetative cover, and the season of the year. Local differences in conditions cause more ground water to be discharged from some parts of the area than from others. Large quantities of water are withdrawn by plants from the zone of saturation of the bottom land a^ng the North Platte River and at other places where the water table is close to the land surface. Only very small quantities, if any, are withdrawn by plants where the water table is far below the land surface, but in such areas the vegetation indirectly effects ground-water recharge and discharge by consuming water from precipitation before it can become ground-water recharge. The discharge of ground water by streams and springs is, of course, limited to areas where the topography is such that the land surface intersects the water table.

STREAMS AND DRAINS
The contour map of the water table (pi. 1) shows that the general direction of movement of ground water in the area is toward the North Platte River. Much of the ground water is discharged directly into the river; however, some of it is intercepted by tributaries and drains, which carry the water to the river. Most of the ground water discharged by the streams and drains in the area is return flow from irrigation that is, water that has been added to the zone of saturation by seepage from irrigation canals and irrigated fields. However, much of the ground water that is derived from infiltration of precipitation on the upland areas percolates to the stream valleys and is discharged into streams or into drains.
Horse and Sheep Creeks, which are fed by ground water in the area, discharge into the North Platte Eiver in Nebraska. The flow of Horse Creek, which for the water year 1949-50 amounted to 49,860 acre-feet, was derived almost entirely from ground-water discharge and runoff from irrigation and precipitation. Essentially all the flpw was derived from ground-water runoff that was contributed to the stream south of the North Platte project area.
Prior to irrigation no perennial streams flowed into the North Platte Eiver between Torrington and the Wyoming-Nebraska State line; at present three perennial drains (the Cherry Creek, Katzer, and Arnold drains) contribute to the flow of the river. The total annual discharge of these drains is about 40,000 acre-feet, more than half of which is
416648 57 5

60 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
ground-water runoff; the remainder is largely derived from surface irrigation runoff.
An analysis was made of the flow of the North Platte River between the gaging station 2*4 miles downstream from Whalen Dam (Whalen station) and the gaging station % mile upstream from the WyomingNebraska State line (State line station) to determine the gain in flow in this section. Between the stations all diversions from the river and essentialy all inflow to the river from tributaries are measured. Diversions are made into the Burbank, Lucerne, Grattan, Bock Ranch, Torrington, North Platte, Narrows, Pratt-Ferris, French, and Mitchell-Gering canals, and inflow is from the Laramie River, Sand Point Draw, Sand Draw, Rawhide Creek, Cherry Creek drain, Arnold drain, North Platte waste, and Katzer drain, and from the Lingle powerp]ant. The total pickup was computed by subtracting from the discharge at the Whalen station the diversions below this station and then subtracting the resulting figure from the amount of flow at the State line. The invisible pickup was obtained by subtracting the aggregate quantity of water discharged by tributaries into the river from the total gain. The results of the computations, based on monthly discharges from October 1947 through September 1951, are shown graphically by block diagrams in figure 7.
In figure 7 the total height above the baseline of the left side of each block represents the measured discharge of the river at the Whalen station, and the total height above the baseline of the right side of each block represents the measured discharge at the State-line station. Thus, the direction of slope of the line across the top of the block shows whether a net gain or loss of flow occurred during that month, and the difference in height of the sides of the block indicates the magnitude of the gain or loss.
If diversions for irrigation were made during the month, the left side of the block has been divided into two parts; the upper part represents the magnitude of the diversions and the lower part represents the quantity of water that would pass the State-line station if no other gain or loss occurred. For some months when the diversions exceed the flow at Whalen Dam, such as September 1949, the lower part is negative and is, therefore, plotted below the base line.
The right-hand side is divided into three parts. The upper part represents the magnitude of the measured visible pickup (discharge of the tributaries) in the section, the lower part represents the flow that should pass the State-line station if no gain or loss takes place in the section, and the middle part represents, therefore, the invisible gain. A diagonal line is drawn to separate the visible gain from the invisible gain. Thus, two or three triangles are formed at the top of each block, depending on whether water was diverted; the area of each triangle is proportional to the magnitude of the gain or

The area of the upper triangle is proportional to the volume of water diverted for irrigation, the area of the middle triangle is proportional to the volume of water discharge by the tributaries into the river (visible pickup), and the area of the lower triangle is proportional to the volume of water gained in the segment (invisible pickup).
The diagrams in figure 7 indicate the general regimen of the North Platte Kiver between Whalen Dam and the State line. They show that during most of the year practically all the flow at the State line is derived from invisible pickup and tributary inflow below Whalen Dam. Occasionally during June, July, or August, the diversions exceed the gain and the flow of the river in the stretch is reduced.
For some nionths, notably those in the summer of 1949, the bottoms of the diagrams lie below the baseline, which indicates that the volume of; water diverted was greater than the volume that passed Whalen Dam. During May, June, and September, 1949, more water was diverted above the State line than passed the Whalen station. Obviously, for this to happen, water had to be added to the river or the river would, of course, have been dry above the State line. The flow of the river was maintained by visible and invisible gain. The invisible pickup, which in many months is greater than the visible pickup, constitutes a large proportion of the total gain of the river.
The amount of invisible pickup in the North Platte Kiver depends largely upon the gradient of the water table toward the river; this gradient varies with the fluctuations of the water table in the valley of the river. As shown in figure 6, the amount of invisible pickup in the river varies almost in direct proportion to the average position of the water level in the observation wells in the area. Minor variations are caused by the effects of evapotranspiration.
An analysis was made to determine the amount of the visible ground-water gain of the river that was contributed by tributary discharge. The water discharged by the tributaries consists of surface flow that enters the area, direct runoff from precipitation and irrigation within the area, and ground-water runoff within the area. By selecting periods when the first two of these increments are negligible, the third one can be estimated. The ground-water gain is approximately equivalent to the low or base flow of the streams.
The5 Laramie Kiver is the only one of the four principal tributaries of the North Platte River in the area that transmits an appreciable-amount of water into the area as surface flow. Usually the flow in the Laramie Kiver is many times the amount of ground-water gain by the Laramie Kiver within the area; however, a fairly accurate estimate of the amount of ground-water gain in the river can be made. During many months of the nonirrigation season all the

GROUND WATER

" > 63

surface flow of the Laramie River is diverted into the Fort Laramie canal for use in generating power. At these times all the flow oi the Laramie River at its junction with the North Platte River near Fort Laramie is derived from ground-water pickup in the stretch below the diversion. An estimate of the average annual ground-water gain was made by averaging the monthly discharge during these periods for the water years 1947-48 through 1950-51 and multiplying by 12. The average annual ground-water pickup of the Laramie River in the area was calculated to be about 7,000 acre-leet.
The base flow of the other three principal tributaries in the area Rawhide Creek, Cherry Creek drain, and Katzer drain is largely ground-water pickup. During the irrigation season, however, a large amount of direct runoff from irrigation and precipitation is included. The base flow of these streams was estimated by averaging the flow during the months of November and April for the water years 1947-48 through 1950-51. This average is thought to be representative of the base flow throughout the year, as it is computed from base-flow periods after and before the irrigation season. On this basis the annual ground-water gain within the area by these three tributaries is about 31,000 acre-feet. The flow of Rawhide Creek is perennial, but as the flow is small it is though to have a negligible effect on the above determinations.
The average annual invisible gain in the North Platte River for the 4-year period of study was about 179,000 acre-feet. This, added to the 7,000 acre-feet of pickup in the Laramie River and the 3.1,000 acre-feet of pickup in the three other tributaries, gives a total annual ground-water runoff of about 217,000 acre-feet.

EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
Water may be taken into the roots of plants directly from the zone of saturation or from the capillary fringe above it, and then discharged from the plants by the process known as transpiration, or it may be brought to the land surface by capillary action and discharged directly from the soil by evaporation. The depths from which plants will lift ground water varies greatly with different types of plants and with different soils and conditions of water supply.
Most of the discharge of ground water by transpiration is thought to occur where the depth to water is less than 20 feet. The areas of high evapotranspiration are shown on plate 4. Grasses are the principal users of ground water in most of these areas; however, on the flood plain of the North Platte River the chief, users are cottonwood and willow trees.
No data were obtained during this investigation on the rate at which ground water is evaporated and transpired in the report area.

64 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
In Scotts Bluff County, Nebr., which adjoins the report area on the east, the quantity of ground water evaporated and transpired from the zone of saturation in shallow-water areas was estimated to be 18 inches a year. (See Wenzel, Cady, and Waite, 1946, p. 118.) Tomlinson (1051, p. 11) estimated that, in addition to the precipitation during the growing season, 14.4 inches of water will be used by grasses in the area. The amount used by the cottonwood and willow trees along the streams is assumed to be considerably greater than 14.4 inches. Consequently, the average value of 18 inches is thought to be more representative.
Where the water table is close enough to the land surface to cause the discharge of ground water by evaporation, a residue of watersoluble minerals generally is left at the surface. The depth from which water may be brought to the land surface by capillarity depends upon the texture of the material above the water table the finer grained the material, the greater the distance the water will rise. Very little water is believed to be brought to the land surface where the depth to water is more than 10 feet. The amount of water evaporated directly from the soil surface depends upon the depth to the water table and the type of soil and on the extent of the vegetative cover. Under natural conditions the growth of grass is so dense in the areas of shallow water table that practically no evaporation occurs directly from the soil surface. When the land in these areas is farmed and left without vegetation during part of the year, the opportunity for evaporation from the land surface is great, and a gradual buildup of salts at the land surface takes place. If farming is continued on such land, the crops are gradually restricted to the more salt-tolerant varieties, and eventually even these will not germinate.
The water table beneath 43,600 acres in the county, of which .37,500 acres of land is in the North Platte project area, lies sufficiently close to the land surface so that evapotranspiration takes place. (See pi. 4.) Assuming that an average of 18 inches of water is transpired and evaporated each year from the zone of saturation, the annual evapotranspiration loss from the ground-water reservoir in the county is about 65,000 acre-feet, of which about 56,000 acre-feet is from the North Platte project area. To this quantity must be added the part of the water pumped from wells that is evaporated and transpired.
WELLS
In the county about 8,700 acre-feet of ground water is pumped annually for irrigation, industrial, stock, domestic, and municipal uses; these uses are listed in what is believed to be the order of quantity .pumped. Of the 8,700 acre-feet of water, 7,400 acre-feet was pumped

GROUND WATER

in the North Platte project area. The quantity of water pumped for each of the different uses is given on pages 69-70. About 4,000 acrefeet of the water pumped from wells in the county is consumed and the remainder returns to the water table or enters the river. Of the 4,000 acre-feet of pumped water that annually is consumptively used in the county, about 3,000 acre-feet is consumed in the North Platte Irrigation Project area.

SUBSURFACE OUTFLOW
A considerable quantity of ground water moves through the valley fill across the Wyoming-Nebraska State line. Most of the outflow occurs in the valley of the North Platte Eiver; very little is thought to leave the county through the valley fill of Horse and Sheep Creeks. An estimate of the amount of ground water leaving the area through the valley fill of the North Platte Eiver was made by the application of Darcy's law. The average coefficient of permeability of the floodplain deposits is taken as 4,500 gpd per mile-foot per foot per mile of -gradient, the cross-sectional area of the saturated part of these deposits is 217 mile-feet, and the downvalley gradient of the water table is about 6 feet per mile; thus, between 6,500 and 7,000 acre-feet of water leaves the area each year through the flood-plain deposits. The coefficient of permeability of the third-terrace deposits is assumed to be 2,300 gpd. This permeability of the terrace sand and gravel is based on pumping tests that were made on two widely spaced wells well 25-61-33ab in the area and well 24-57-34badl in the nearby Dutch Flats area (Babcock and Visher, 1951, p. 15-17). In each test the coefficient of permeability obtained was 2,300 gpd. The coefficient of permeability obtained from a pumping test on well 24-61-2cb is not considered to be representative of the coefficient of permeability of the third-terrace deposits because the well discharges water from a local highly permeable channel deposit. The cross-sectional area of the saturated part of the third-terrace deposits at the east edge of the area is 425 mile-feet, and the downvalley gradient of the water table is 20 feet per mile; thus, about 22,000 acre-feet of water leaves the area annually through this material. Some water leaves the area by underflow through the bedrock, but the amount is believed to be small in comparison to the amount that leaves the area through the unconsolidated materials.

STORAGE EQUATION FOE NORTH PLATTE PROJECT AREA
The amount of water that is recharged to the ground-water reservoir during a year is equal to the amount of water that is discharged, plus or minus the change in storage during the year. Sufficient data were not available for approximating the total amount of discharge from Goshen County; however, it was possible to make an approximation of the total amount of discharge from the North Platte project

66 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
area. About 217,000 acre-feet of ground water is estimated to have been discharged from the North Platte project area by streams and drains during the period 1948-51; about 59,000 acre-feet of ground water was discharged by evapotranspiration (including 3,000 of the 7.400 acre-feet pumped from wells); and about 29,000 acre-feet of ground water was discharged by underflow. Therefore, a total of about 305,000 acre-feet was discharged from the ground-water reservoir in the North Platte project area each year.
About 202,000 acre-feet of the water that enters the North Platte project area in canals is estimated to have been recharged to the water table each year from the canals and irrigated fields, and about 6,000 acre-feet was recharged from underflow into the area through the alluvium. No estimate was made of the amount of recharge from precipitation in the area or from underflow into the project area through the bedrock formations. Eecords of the water level show that essentially no annual change in storage occurs; therefore, the amount of recharge from these sources should be approximately equal to the difference between the recharge, from irrigation and underflow through the alluvium, and the total discharge. This amounts to 97,000 acre-feet. No attempt was made to determine the amounts contributed by each of the factors. The figure includes also any errors involved in estimating the other items of the analysis.
QUANTITY OF WATER IN STORAGE
Most of the recoverable ground water in the county is in the unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits of the valley fill, and the Arikaree formation. The approximate amount of ground water in storage was calculated for only the unconsolidated deposits of the valley fill of the North Platte River. The extent of these deposits and their saturated thickness are shown on plate 3. The quantity of ground water in storage in these deposits was determined roughly by multiplying the volume of saturated material (7,400,000 acre-feet) by the average specific yield, 0.23, determined in three pumping tests. The volume of saturated material was determined from the saturated-thickness map of the area and represents an average saturated thickness of about 81 feet beneath about 91,000 acres. The volume of water in storage computed from these figures is about 1,700,000 acre-feet. From the present position of the water table an estimate of the quantity of ground water represented by a foot of rise or decline of the water table was computed to be 21,000 acre-feet.
RECOVERY OF GROUND WATEIt
SPRINGS AND SEEPS
There are many small springs and seeps in the county, but only a few are shown 011 plate 4. These springs and seeps supply small quantities

GROUND WATER

67

of water, which are used primarily for watering livestock. All the springs observed in the area are gravity springs; that is, the water does not issue under artesian pressure but discharges by gravity along outcrops of the water table. There are two types of gravity springs in the area : depression springs, where water flows to the surface from. permeable material because the land surface extends below the water table ; and contact springs, whose waters flow to the surface from permeable material over the outcrop of material of relatively low permeability, which retards the downward percolation of the ground water. Depression springs generally are found in the alluvium along the stream valleys and in the lowland areas. Contact springs occur mainly along the contact between the Brule and Arikaree formations on the faces of the escarpments that surround the Goshen Hole lowland.

Types of wells. Most of the wells in the area are drilled wells
cased with steel casing that ranges in sizes from about 2 to 24 inches in diameter. Practically all the irrigation, public-supply, and industrial wells in the area are drilled. A few dug wells, generally ranging from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, have been constructed for domestic and stock use. Most of the dug wells are cribbed with concrete, brick, rock, or wood. A few small-diameter driven wells have been installed for domestic and stock use at places where the water table is near the surface.
Drilling methods. Most of the drilled wells in the area were put down; by either the cable-tool, standard hydraulic-rotary, or the reverse-rotary method. Both small- and large-diameter wells and test holes were drilled by the cable-tool method. The standard hydraulicrotary method was used for drilling small-diameter wells and test holes, and the reverse-rotary method was used for drilling large-diameter wells.
The cable-tool method of drilling (sometimes referred to as the percussion or churn-drill method) is done by means of a string of solid drilling tools with a cutting bit on the bottom, operated in the drill hole on the end of a cable that is lifted and dropped regularly to produce a cutting or drilling action at the bottom of the hole. The material is removed from the bottom of the hole by means of a bailer or sand bucket. Usually a casing is forced into the hole as the drilling proceeds, and the drill, and bailer or sand bucket, are lowered and withdrawn through the casing.
Many of the small-diameter wells in the area have been drilled by the standard hydraulic-rotary method. Holes ranging from about 4 to about 8 inches in diameter have been drilled by this method. Drilling is done by rotating the drilling tools which are at the bottom of a

68 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
string of drilling pipe. During the process of drilling, water is pumped downward through the revolving drill stem and bit into the bottom of the hole and up the hole to the land surface into a sump pit where the water is taken by the pump and recirculated. Materials drilled from, the bottom of the hole are carried to the surface by the water. Mud, clay, or some manufactured product generally is used to increase the viscosity and material-lifting capacity of the water and also to seal the hole and prevent caving and the loss of drilling water by seepage into permeable materials.
The standard hydraulic-rotary method of water-well drilling generally is limited to holes of small diameter, owing to the difficulty of providing enough water in the drill hole to maintain sufficient velocity to carry the drill cuttings to the land surface. This disadvantage has been overcome in the reverse-rotary method of drilling by reversing the direction of flow of the circulating water; hence, the name "reverse rotary." By this method the water is pumped up the hollow drill stem and discharged into the settling pit where the drill cuttings remain. The water runs back to the drill hole by gravity. Enough water is provided to keep the drill hole full at all times, so that the hydrostatic pressure will prevent caving. A slowly revolving bit at the lower end of the drill stem cuts or scrapes the material loose from the bottom of the hole. Generally, a hole about 48 inches in diameter is drilled, a perforated casing of smaller size is placed in the hole, and the annular space around the casing is packed with sorted gravel.
Methods of lift. Many of the domestic and stock wells in the area are equipped with lift or force pumps in which the cylinders are placed below the water table. These pumps generally are operated by windmills or by electric motor. The domestic wells, where electric power is available, are usually equipped with pumps that force water into pressure systems. In parts of the area where the depth to water is not great, generally less than 15 feet, many wells are equipped with hand-operated pitcher pumps.
Most of the large municipal, industrial, and irrigation wells are equipped with turbine pumps operated by electric motors or diesel engines. Where the water is within suction lift, some of the large wells are equipped with horizontal centrifugal pumps.
UTILIZATION OF GKOUND WATEK
During the course of the investigation information about 938 wells in the county was obtained. All known irrigation, public-supply, and industrial wells were visited, and all available data concerning them were compiled. No attempt was made to inventory all the domestic and stock wells, but data pertaining to some of them were collected in areas where information was needed. Pertinent data on

GROUND WATER

6&

the wells that were inventoried during the investigation are given in table 7, and the location of the wells is shown on plate 4.

DOMESTIC AND STOCK SUPPLIES
Most of the rural residents and the residents of some of the smaller towns in the area obtain their domestic and stock-water supplies from wells of small diameter equipped with cylinder pumps operated by windmill, by hand, or by small electric motors. Most of the domestic wells located where electric power is available are equipped with electrically powered pumps that pump water into pressure systems. In the valleys of the North Platte River and its tributaries, where the water table is shallow many of the domestic and stock supplies are derived from shallow driven wells. The driven wells were not inventoried because very little information about them was available.
About 600 acre-feet of water is estimated to be used annually in the county for domestic and stock supplies.
The ground water in the area varies greatly in chemical character, but generally is satisfactory for most domestic and stock uses.

PUBLIC SUPPLIES
Three municipalities (Torrington, Lingle, and Yoder) in the county have public water systems that obtain water from wells. The average daily consumption of these municipalities aggregates about 800,000 gallons. The remaining municipalities in the area do not have public water systems, and water is supplied by privately owned wells.
Torrington (population 3,247) is supplied by four drilled wells within the city limits. The wells range in depth from 60 to 90 feet. The wells obtain water from the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River valley and are reported to yield from 450 to 1,000 gpm. The wells are equipped with electrically powered turbine or centrifugal pumps that pump water directly into the city mains and force water into a 50,000-gallon steel tank, which maintains an average operating pressure of about 45 pounds to the square inch in the city distribution system. The annual consumption of water in 1951 was about 270,000,000 gallons, which is equivalent to an average rate of consumption of about 740,000 gpd or 510 gpm. The results of ths analyses of water from wells 24-61-10bc, 24-61-10bd, and 24-61-10cbl (see table 3) indicate that the water is hard; the water is not treated.
Lingle (population 403) is supplied by three drilled wells within the city limits. The wells are about 50 feet deep and obtain water from the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River valley. The wells are equipped with electrically powered turbine or centrifugal pumps which pump water directly into the city mains and force water' into a 55,000-gallon steel tank, which maintains an average operating

70 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
pressure of about 45 pounds per square inch in the city distribution system. The annual consumption of water in 1951 was about 10,000,000 gallons, which is equivalent to an average rate of consumption of about 27,000 gpd or 19 gpm. The analysis of water from well 25-62-18db3 indicates that the water is hard; the water is not treated.
Yocler (population 128) is supplied by two drilled wells within the city limits. The wells are 80 and 101 feet deep and obtain water from sandstone in the Lance formation. They are reported to yield less than 100 gpm with a drawdown of about 70 feet. The wells are equipped with electrically powered turbine pumps which pump water directly into the city mains and force water into a 40,000-gallon tank. No information on the rate of consumption of water is available, but the annual consumption is estimated to be about 3,000,000 gallons; this is equivalent to an average daily rate of consumption of about 8,000 gpd or 6 gpm.
INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES
Ground water is used by several industries in the area. A sugar refinery at Torrington obtains water from three wells for use in washing beets and refining sugar. These wells, which are drilled into the flood-plain deposits, supply a total of about 6,000 gpm to the factory during the operating season, for a total of about 2,400 acrefeet per year. The Union Pacific Railroad Co. pumps water from wells at Torrington, Yoder, and Lagrange. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Kailroad Co. owns and operates wells at Torrington and Fort Laramie.
IRRIGATION SUPPLIES
History of development. Seventy-three irrigation wells in the county were inventoried during the study. Sixty-one of these wells are in the North Platte project area. These wells are shown on plate 4 and pertinent data are given in table 7. All the irrigation wells in the county at the end of 1951 are thought to have been included in the inventory. About three-quarters of the irrigation wells have been drilled in recent years (since 1946). The remaining quarter were drilled before 1946; the earliest recorded date is 1930.
Quantity of water pumped. Forty-five of the seventy-three irrigation wells in the county were pumped during 1951. These wells pumped a total of about 4,800 acre-feet of water, of which about 3,700 acre-feet was pumped within the North Platte project area. The amount of water pumped was determined by assuming that the average amount of water pumped per well was equivalent to the average amount pumped from wells for which measurements were made that is, from wells that are equipped with electrically powered pumps. The quantity of water pumped for irrigation by electrically powered

--' -"

pumps in the area during 1951 was calculated from records of power consumption supplied by the power companies and from measurements of the rate of power input and the rate of well discharge that were made during the investigation. The rate of power input to the motors was determined by clocking the electric watt-hour meters with a stopwatch, and the total duration of pumping during the year was determined by dividing the total amount of power consumed during the year by the rate of power input. Measurements of the rate of discharge were made with a Hoff current meter, which was inserted into the discharge pipe of each pumping plant and moved about in a prescribed horizontal, vertical, and circular pattern while being timed with a stopwatch in order to obtain an integrated average velocity of the discharging water. The rate of discharge was then computed by applying the empirically derived formula (Eohwer, 1942, p. 3-40)

in which Z^the discharge of the pump, in gallons per minute; J.=the cross-sectional area of the discharge pipe, in square feet;
and F^the average integrated velocity of the discharging water, in feet per second.
Power required for pumping water. The cost of pumping water from a well depends upon the cost of drilling the well and installing the pump, the cost of the fuel or power, and the cost of maintenance and operation. The only cost that could be determined with any reasonable degree of accuracy was the cost of the electric power for the few electrically powered units in the area. This is given in kilowatt-hours rather than in dollars and cents because a complicated sliding scale is used in charging for the use of electric power. The average amount of electric power required to pump an acre-foot of water was computed to be 1.90 kilowatt-hours per foot of lift. The average overall efficiency of the electrically powered units was calculated to be 54 percent.

POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL LABGE SUPPLIES OP WATER,

Additional large supplies of water can be developed from several

aquifers in Goshen County. In most places in the flood-plain deposits

of the North Platte Kiver, wells yielding 1,000 to 3,000 gpm could

be developed. In many places in the third-terrace deposits, wells

.yielding 500 to 1,500 gpm probably could be developed. In places

in the flood-plain deposits along Horse and Bear Creeks in the vicinity

of Lagrange, wells having yields of 500 to 1,000 gpm could be de-

veloped. In favorable areas, wells with possible yields of 500 to 1,000

gpm could be developed in the Arikaree formation.

.

72 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
. In general the amount of water that can be pumped depends upon the saturated thickness of the aquifer. The performance of existing wells indicates that wells having a capacity of 1,000 gpm or more probably can be developed at almost any place in the flood-plain deposits of the North Platte River where the saturated thickness exceeds 50 feet. However, in the flood-plain deposits along Rawhide Creek and along Horse and Bear Creeks, in the third-terrace deposits, and in the flood-plain deposits along the North Platte River where the saturated thickness is shown to be less than 50 feet, the installation of large-capacity wells should be preceded by test drilling in order to determine the permeability and the saturated thickness of the material.
The amount of water that can be withdrawn from the ground-water reservoir without causing excessive permanent lowering of the water table depends upon the capacity of, and the amount of recharge to. the ground-water reservoir. If water is pumped from the ground-water reservoir at a greater average rate than the average rate of recharge, the water level declines and the supply eventually is depleted. If the recharge during the nonpumping period replaces the pumped water, the discharge can exceed the average rate of recharge for short periods of time without causing serious lowering of the water level. In this way the aquifer could be used as a storage reservoir, to which water could be added or from which water could be withdrawn. To develop the maximum amount of ground water from the valley fill, water must be pumped in excess of the rate of recharge during the growing season.
For the four water years 1947-48 through 1950-51 an average of about 217,000 acre-feet of ground water left the North Platte project area annually as surface flow this represents the amount of rejected or excess ground water. In addition to this amount, about 29,000 acre-feet of ground water is estimated to leave the area as underflow through the valley fill, and about 59,000 acre-feet is discharged by evapotranspiration, including about 3,000 acre-feet of the water discharged by wells. The withdrawal and consumptive use of a large additional quantity of ground water in the area would cause a decline in the amount of ground-water pickup by the streams. However, ground water used by industry for cooling or in some other nonconsumptive way would have no net effect on the flow of the North Platte River. If sufficient ground water were withdrawn to cause a decline of the water .table, additional water would be salvaged from the present loss by evapotranspiration and would be available for irrigation and other uses. Of course, some of the water pumped for irrigation would return to the ground-water reservoir as recharge. Thus, the amount consumptively used, and not balanced by a decrease in evapotranspiration, would represent a potential decrease in the pickup oi the river.

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE GROUND WATER

73

If an extensive program of ground-water development is undertaken in the area in the future, records should be kept of the amount of water that is pumped and of the changes in water level, and water samples should be collected periodically from selected wells for chemical analysis.

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE GROUND WATER
By W. H. DUKUM
Closely allied to problems of quantity of ground water are those relating to the quality of ground water. An insufficient supply or the overdevelopment of ground water in an area is sometimes associated with undesirable chemical characteristics of that water excessive amounts of dissolved solids, chloride, iron, or manganese, or other substandard characteristics such as excessive hardness or corrosiveness. These problems are related to the geologic and hydrologic factors in an area.
Perhaps equally important is the fact that land-use practices involving reuse of water, such as large-scale irrigation, tend to modify the quality of water through concentration of the shallow water by evaporation and transpiration, which may involve deposition and re-solution of salts in the soil or at the ground surface. Ultimately this process may adversely affect the water user down iream, as the irrigation waste water that reaches the stream either through drains or by underground movement contains more dissolved solids than the water that was applied to the land originally.
Chemical analyses were made of water samples collected in Goshen County in order to determine the general usability of the ground water and the possibility of future changes in quality. The geologic formations exposed in the area have long yielded water for domestic and stock purposes; therefore, it could be assumed that the supplies from these aquifers generally are potable. However, accurate data relating to the degree and type of hardness, the quantities of iron, fluoride, and nitrate, and the percentage of sodium are needed for more careful appraisal of the ground-water resource. Furthermore, current data on water quality will need to be collected in the future to show what effect irrigation in the area has on the chemical character of the ground water. The writer (in Visher and Babcock, 1953) has shown that, in some parts of Goshen County, waterlogging causes local deterioration of the chemical quality of the ground water in shallow aquifers.
COLLECTION OF DATA
During the investigation, samples of ground water were collected from all the principal water-bearing sources in the county. Chemical analyses of the water samples from the 52 wells and 6 seeps or springs sampled are given in table 3; figure 8 shows location of sampling

points. These samples were collected during the period August to November 1951. Most of the samples were obtained from wells in the valley fill, which is the most important aquifer in the area. Three wells were resampled during pumping tests to determine whether any significant changes in the quality of the water occurred during the pumping period.
Earlier analyses of 16 ground-water samples, principally from shallow augered holes, and 1 surface-water sample collected in the Soil and Moisture Conservation Demonstration Area (Visher and Babcock, 1953) have been used in this report to supplement the data collected during the present study. These analyses are given in table 4. Information pertaining to the ground-water supplies that were sampled is summarized below.

A qualitative study also was made of the mineralization of the water in streams that are tributary to the North Platte River and of the effects of surface inflow on the quality of the water in the North Platte River between Whalen Dam and the Nebraska State line. Samples representing the quality of water before, at the peak of, and after the irrigation season were collected in March, August, and October, 1951, respectively, from the Laramie River, Deer Creek, the Cherry Creek drain, Rawhide Creek, Horse Creek, and the North Platte River. The Interstate canal and the Fort Laramie canal were sampled only once during the investigation. However, Geological Survey records for continuous periods of sampling during 1951 of the North Platte River below Guernsey Reservoir supplement these data that were obtained during the peak of the irrigation season. Chemical analyses of the samples are given in table 5, and the location of the sampling points is shown in figure 8. Some of these analyses consist of only a few individual determinations.
Although the suitability of water for all uses cannot be measured by a single criterion, it is now generally accepted that water supplies serving public, domestic, and general industrial purposes should be

82 GEOLOGY, 'GROUND-WATER (RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO,
clear, pleasant tasting, preferably of moderately low temperature, neither corrosive nor scale forming, free from minerals producing undersirable physiological effects, and free from disease-producing organisms. Water for irrigation has special requirements, principally in the amount of dissolved solids, boron, and the percentage of sodium. The discussion of water quality in this report pertains only to the chemical quality of the water and does not relate to the sanitary quality of the individual supplies, except that a high nitrate and chloride content might be an indication of pollution.
Certain criteria have been developed for use in the evaluation of water with respect to its general suitability as an irrigation supply. These criteria are discussed more fully on pages 92-93.
PRINCIPAL CONSTITUENTS
Water percolating through soil and rocks exerts a solvent action upon the materials through which is passes. This solvent action is greatly increased by the presence of carbon dioxide, which is formed by organic processes and which is absorbed from the atmosphere and from the soil, as well as by organic acids formed in the soil. The amount and the character of the dissolved mineral matter in a water depend on the chemical and physical composition of the rocks through which the water passes, the duration of the contact, and other factors such as temperature and pressure.
The tables of analyses show results for dissolved solids, silica, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, carbonate, sulfate, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, specific conductance, boron, hardness, and percentage of sodium (percent sodium as used by Scofield, 1938, p. 4-5). The chemical constituents are reported in parts per million, 1 ppm being equivalent to 1 milligram of a given constituent in 1 liter (1 kilogram) of water, or 8.34 pounds of constituent per million gallons of water. Perhaps of principal interest to water users in Goshen County are the results for dissolved solids, iron, fluoride, nitrate, hardness, and percent sodium. Each is defined and its importance is described briefly in the following discussion. For more detailed discussion of these and other substances, results for which appear in the tables of analyses, the reader is referred to the introductory section of any water-supply paper published annually by the Geological Survey, entitled "Quality of surface waters of the United States."
The term dissolved solids refers to the amount of dissolved mineral matter that remains after the water has been evaporated. Some organic material as well as some water of crystallization may be included in the residue. For this report, dissolved solids exceeding 1,000 ppm are reported in most analyses as the sum of the determined constituents; this method of reporting is more accurate for higher

concentrations if the principal constituents including sjtliea have been determined. Water having less than 500 ppm of dissolved solids is satisfactory for domestic and many industrial uses; water i containing more than 1,000 ppm may cause physiological disturbances except to those accustomed to the use of water of such high mineral
content. Iron in alkaline water is generally in the form of ferrous bicar-
bonate; the iron is derived from rocks or from the pipes through which corrosive water flows. Water containing more than a few tenths of a part per million of iron is objectionable owing to its taste and to its ability to stain, which results from the oxidation of the iron. Iron is sometimes a problem in water from both the shallow and the deep sources in this area. Most of the analyses, however, indicate that iron in the water should not be much of a problem.
Fluoride in water supplies is related to both the mottling of tooth enamel and the incidence of dental caries (tooth decay) in the permanent teeth of children (Dean, 1943). A fluoride concentration of about 1.0 to 1.5 ppm in the water supplies greatly lessens the incidence of dental caries in the permanent teeth of children who use the water. Mottling of tooth enamel is caused by the use of water in which the fluoride concentration is greater than about 1.5 ppm; the severity of mottling increases with the fluoride content of the water.
Water from most of the shallow sources in this area contains lessthan 1.0 ppm of fluoride, but some water from the Chadron and Lance formations contains more than 2.0 ppm.
Nitrate may be produced by oxidation of nitrogenous material.. The presence of large amounts of this ion generally is interpreted tobe an indication of pollution; however, it may be an indication of the action of harmless bacteria in the soil mantle through which thewater percolates, or of past fertilization of fields in the recharge area. Kecent studies (Maxcy, 1950, p. 265) show that a high concentration^ of nitrate in drinking water may be a contributing factor in the development of cyanosis in infants (blue baby). Two wells in theBrule formation yielded water having nitrate (a? NO3 ) in excess* of 45 ppm, which is considered by many authorities to be the tolerableupper limit for supplies used in the feeding of infants.
Hardness is due principally to the salts of calcium and magnesium in solution. Because calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and, to a lesser extent, magnesium carbonate are present in the principal aquifers in the area, ground water derived from these aquifers contains varying amounts of calcium and magnesium, and therefore is fairly hard. The quantity of other hardness-forming constituents, such as iron, aluminum, zinc, barium, and strontium, in water in this area is not; sufficient to have any appreciable effect upon total hard-

84 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATEE RESOUECES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
ness. The hardness equivalent to the bicarbonate in a water is called carbonate (temporary) hardness; the remainder, noncarbonate (permanent) hardness.
Excessive hardness is recognized by the large quantity of soap required to produce lather and by the formation of an insoluble curd in all washing processes in which soap is used. Excessive hardness in water supplies is particularly objectionable in many industrial operations.
CHEMICAL CHARACTER IN RELATION TO SOURCE
Water in unconsolidated deposits in this area differs in chemical character from water in the bedrock. In addition to having some noncarbonate hardness, the water in the unconsolidated deposits is harder and has a lower percentage of sodium. The differences between the waters from the two sources increase progressively with the greater age of the bedrock formation. For example, water in the Lance formation generally is more highly mineralized, lower in silica content, and softer than water in the younger bedrock and in the valley fill.
In the following sections, descriptions are included for only those deposits that constitute aquifers of some importance at present. Thus, analyses were not made for samples of water from the Pliocene Channel deposits, Pleistocene upland deposits, or deposits of the second terrace or the dune sand.
Chadron and Lance formations. The chemical character of water from the Chadron and Lance formations is similar, but it is unlike that of water in the younger rocks. (See table 3.) In addition to a higher content of dissolved solids, the water in the Chadron and Lance formations generally has undergone nearly complete natural softening. In the Chadron formation this softening is thought to occur mainly in the bentonitic silt and clay of the upper unit. The water from both formations is principally of the sodium bicarbonate type and generally has a pH greater than 8.3. The average for silica in samples from wells is about 11 ppm, which is much lower than the average for silica in the water from unconsolidated materials. The large amount of bicarbonate and small amount of sulfate in some samples of water from the Lance formation are probably due to natural reduction of sulfate perhaps as a result of the presence of thin beds of dark carbonaceous shale and coal. The reduction of sulfate and a resultant equivalent increase in bicarbonate is nearly complete in water from the deep sources in the Lance formation. The percent sodium was generally above 95. The concentration of fluoride in two samples exceeded 2.0 ppm.
Brute formatidn. This discussion of the quality of the water from the Brule formation is based on the analyses of nine samples (table 3) and on data obtained in earlier investigations in Wyoming (Bab-

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE GROUND WATER

85

cock and B-app, 1952, p. 18-19). The concentration of dissolved solids Is moderate, ranging from 250 to 584 ppm. The hardness is variable,
although it is generally less than that in the sand and gravel of the valley fill.
Differences in the observed quality of water from shallow sources in the Brule. formation probably are due to a large extent to internal factors. One of these factors is the low permeability of the finegrained materials that compose the formation; the slow movement of water through much of this aquifer allows alteration of the dissolved chemical constituents of the water that percolates from the overlying materials. The percent sodium is generally higher, but the total mineral content is approximately the same as in water from overlying sources. On the other hand, fractures in the Brule formation allow water from other sources to move rapidly through the formation without significant change in chemical composition during the movement. Thus, water from the Brule may differ substantially in composition, depending on whether it moves slowly or quickly through the iormation.
The results of the analysis of water from well 26-61-35dd (table 3) indicate that in water from deep sources in the Brule formation .sodium has almost completely replaced calcium and magnesium. The samples of water from the Brule formation contained above-normal ^quantities of nitrate, which likely was derived from surface sources.
AriJcaree formation. Because of its topographic position away from the irrigated areas and its upgradient position with respect to water movement in the area, the Arikaree formation would be expected to .yield water that is lower in dissolved solids than that in the river valleys. Seven of the eight samples from this source contained less than 400 ppm of dissolved solids, but the water for the most part is hard.
Deposits of the third 'terrace. The samples from the deposits of the third terrace were obtained from wells between Torrington and the Interstate canal. The water from the several sources was nearly uniform in quality and was of the calcium bicarbonate or calcium sulfate type (table 3). The concentration of dissolved solids (450 to 554 ppm) and the hardness (234 to 343 ppm) are comparable to those for water from the flood-plain deposits. Because the terrace deposits receive recharge from canal seepage and other surface water in addition to precipitation, the quality of water in shallow beds adjacent to canals probably is similar to that of the irrigation water. However, the chemical quality of the water becomes increasingly modified at greater distances from the infiltration area.
Flood-plain deposits. Most of the samples obtained from the floodplain deposits were from wells in the valley of the North Platte Itiver. The water obtained from this source probably is a mixture -of the water that moves through the valleys of the North Platte

86 GEOLOGY, GROUND-WATER RESOURCES, GOSHEN COUNTY, WYO.
l^iver, the Laramie Eiver, and Eawhide Creek as well as that seeping from canals and irrigated fields. Precipitation is an additional factorthat tends to dilute the water; seasonally, precipitation plus the addition of irrigation water, tends to modify the composition of the shallow water.
Like water in the terrace deposits, water from the flood-plain deposits is moderately low in mineral content and generally is hard. (See table 3.) The observed range in dissolved-solids content wasfrom 324 to 674 ppm. Locally the hardness is less than 200 ppm,. but generally it exceeds 250 ppm. Excessive iron has been a problem, particularly in the water from wells that supply the sugar refinery at Torrington. During the pumping test of well 24-61-15ccl, iron increased from 1.0 ppm at the beginning of the test to 5.3 ppm at the end of 41 hours of continuous pumping. One explanation that has been offered for the increase in iron during normal pumping is that seepage from warehouses storing sugar beets carries iron in solution to the zone of saturation. This appears unlikely, however, because the wells are more than 80 feet deep and because the physical properties of the water and the mineral substances in solution are characteristic of the water from these deposits. Corrosion of the well casing by surface seepage, which permits the entry of shallow water, and finely divided sediments, including iron-bearing minerals, in suspension in the sample as a result of heavy pumping, are factors that are considered most significant.
Silica and noncarbonate hardness are generally more prominent in water from unconsolidated materials than in water from the deeper sources in bedrock.
Slope wash. The chemical quality of the water in the slope wash in general is unsatisfactory where the slope wash overlies either theChadron formation or the unfractured Brule formation. The poor quality of the water is due in part to the low permeability of th& slope wash as well as to the inadequate drainage of the underlying bedrock. The results of analyses of water from seep 22-60-6aa (table 3) and from springs and augered holes in the Soil and Moisture Conservation Demonstration area (table 4) show that the water generally contains appreciable quantities of sulfate and is hard. The results of the analysis of water from augered test hole 24-62-25cc (table 4) show that water of better quality is obtained from the slope wash where it overlies sand and gravel. Water from the slope wash is of similarly better quality where the slope wash overlies fractured, zones of the Brule formation.
TEMPERATURE
Collins (1925) reported that
The temperature of ground water available for industrial supplies is generally from 2° to 3° F above the mean annual air temperature if the water is between'

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE GROUND WATER

87

30 and 60 feet below the surface of the ground. An approximate average for the increase in temperature with depth is about 1° F for each 64 feet.
The mean air temperature for this area is 47.5°F; therefore shallow ground water would be expected to average about 50°F. For 24 samples of water from unconsolidated deposits at depths ranging from 26 to, 210 feet the median temperature was 57°F. A pocket field thermometer with an accuracy of about ±0.5° F was used to measure the temperatures, which ranged from 51° to 59°F. The results obtained are somewhat higher than Collins' estimates which were neces.sarily generalized and did not take into account such factors as summertime application of irrigation water from surface sources to the land, which would .tend to raise temperatures in proportion to the .amount of recharge to the ground-water reservoir.
The median temperature -for 13 samples from the bedrock formations (exclusive of ; one seep) was 53°F. The depth of the wells .sampled ranged from 40 to 470 feet.

GENERAL RELATIONSHIP OF QUALITY OF GROUND AND SURFACE WATERS
The total mineral content or the concentration of a specific substance in water froin unconsolidated materials in the North Platte River valley in general does not increase or decrease downstream from the head of the valley. However, water from the valley fill near the Interstate canal is slightly lower in mineral content than that from the valley fill near the North Platte River in the vicinity of Torrington.
ALKALINITY AND SULFATE
As bicarbonate and sulfate are the two principal anions in the waters from unconsolidated materials, the changes in concentration can be illustrated by plotting the two constituents on a sketch map .showing the location of wells that were sampled in the vicinity of Torrington. The relationship of alkalinity (as carbonate plus bicarbonate) to sulfate in water from the unconsolidated deposits in the Torrington area, expressed in equivalents per million, is shown in figure 9. The concentration of sulfate is nearly uniform, whereas alkalinity increases, but not progressively, away from the Interstate canal. The increase in alkalinity indicates the limy character of the materials. This increase in concentration down gradient from the canal toward the river is not unexpected, inasmuch as canal water moving downslope and mixing with percolating water from irrigated tracts would tend to become more concentrated. It is rather surprising that sulfate .shows so little variation, and it may be an indication that the shallow water ji§;in equilibrium with its geologic environment so far as sulfate .is concerned.

RELEASES FROM GUERNSEY RESERVOIR
Further evidence of the chemical effect of applied irrigation water that is diverted from the North Platte Eiver below Guernsey Eeservoir is shown by data obtained by the U. S. Geological Survey from December 1950 to September 1951. (See table 6.) Samples were obtained at a sampling station below Guernsey Beservoir, and during the period May 3 to September 30 a total of 7 composite samples composed of 88 daily samples (57 percent of total days) were analyzed. The results of these analyses are given below.

Releases from Guernsey Reservoir during the period May to September were considerably lower in dissolved solids than releases during the winter and early spring months of lower discharge; therefore, water of better quality was diverted to the Interstate canal during the irrigation season. The water was quite uniform in concentration during the season; concentrations of dissolved solids ranged from 344 ppm (0.47 ton per acre-foot) to 430 ppm (0.58 ton per acre-foot). These data support the observation that canal seepage tends to dilute shallow ground water in areas that are not waterlogged.
By the same reasoning, it might be expected that during the growing season, May to September, when releases from Guernsey Reservoir are larger than during the rest of the year, some movement of better quality water occurs from the North Platte River to shallow aquifers adjacent to the stream. Consequently, shallow wells drawing water from the flood-plain deposits might be expected to be lower in dissolved solids during this period. Such a situation probably would occur were it not for the fact that, during the irrigation season, ground-water levels .in the irrigated areas are at their peak and movement of the water is in the direction of the North Platte River. Thus, dilution does not take place during the irrigation season, and, shallow ground water in the flood-plain deposits tends to be lower in dissolved solids away from the river than adjacent to it. On the other hand, if, during this period, pumping from wells near the North Platte River was so great as to lower water levels sufficiently to reverse the gradient and induce movement of water from the stream, then it is possible that some lowering in dissolved solids would be observed.
TRIBUTARY FLOW TO NORTH PLATTE RIVER
The results of analyses of surface waters that were sampled prior to, at the peak of, and immediately after the irrigation season are given in table 5. The highest mineralization, 1,690 ppm (2.30 tons per acre-foot), was for water in the Cherry Creek drain (March 27, 1951), and the lowest, 300 ppm (0.41 ton per acre-foot), was for Deer Creek (March 27, 1951). The general relation of sulfate to dissolved solids for the three sampling periods is shown in figure 10. The triangle pattern is formed by plotting sulfate in equivalents per million (epm) and dissolved solids in parts per million (ppni) as two sides of the triangle; the size and shape of the triangle represents the relation of the two variables at the time of the sampling. Little change in the sulfate-dissolved solids relation is shown for the Laramie River, whereas wide fluctuations are shown for the Cherry Creek drain.

FIGURE 11. Tonnages of dissolved solids in water during continuous periods of sampling, North Platte River below Guernsey Reservoir, and in spot samples of water from
tributaries, March to September 1951.

Figure 11 shows the dissolved-solids load, in tons per acre-foot, that passed the sampling station below Guernsey Keservoir during continuous periods of sampling between March and September 1951. The effects of impounding are quite apparent in the uniformity of the load during much of the irrigation season, except during heavy runoff at the end of April and beginning of May. Except for the Cherry Creek drain, spot samples from tributaries that were collected on March 27 show dissolved-solids loads that are appreciably less than releases from Guernsey Reservoir, whereas resamples from the same tributaries in August generally show higher loads than
composite samples for the North Platte River.

QUALITY OF GROUND WATER IN RELATION TO USE
The quality of the water from the valley fill and the Arikaree and Brule formations is generally satisfactory for most domestic needs. The mineral content of the water from unconsolidated deposits averages about 500 ppm, which is the amount that has been specified by the U. S. Public Health Service (1946) as a maximum for water used on common carriers in interstate traffic. In some places the ground water in the flood-plain deposits contains excessive amounts of iron; the water may require aeration or other suitable iron-removal treatment if it is to be satisfactory for domestic and industrial processes. Removal of the silica and other treatment may be necessary if the water is to be used in steam boilers.
Water from bedrock sources older than the Brule formation is generally potable, except that the water from the Lance formation may

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE GROUND WATER

be slightly higher in mineral content than is desirable. However, the water from deeper sources in bedrock generally is relatively soft and, hence, is preferred for some domestic and industrial uses. The fluoride content of three of the seven samples from the Lance formation is greater than is desirable in drinking water for children. The amount of iron in solution in deeper aquifers is very small. According to the standards of Wilcox (1948), water from the unconsolidated deposits is satisfactory for irrigation. Water from deeper sources in the Brule, Chadron, and Lance formations locally is of questionable quality for irrigation because the percentage of sodium is high. (See fig. 12.) This is not a matter of significance, however, because these formations are not capable of yielding large amounts of water to wells for irrigation.

TEST-HOLE AND WELL LOGS
Logs of 104 test holes and wells in Goshen County, Wyo., including 44 test holes drilled for the U. S. Geological Survey are listed under the section "Basic Data." The locatipns of test holes and wells used in constructing the cross sections and the map of the bedrock topography are shown on plates 1 and 2.
The logs entitled "sample logs" are those for which the well cuttings were collected from test holes and studied by J. R. Rapp, geologist of the U. S. Geological Survey. The "drillers' logs" are written logs of wells that were obtained from drillers' records or from other sources, and their terminology is essentially unchanged; however, the geologic interpretations of the logs were made by Rapp. The test-hole and well logs are numbered according to the system used for numbering wells as previously described, ,
Altitudes given in feet and tenths were determined by spirit leveling ; those given in even feet were interpolated using topographic maps or were determined by using an aneroid barometer.
RECORDS OF WELLS AND SPRINGS
Records of 938 wells and springs in Goshen County, which were obtained during the investigation, are listed in the section "Basic Data." The locations of these wells and springs are shown on plate 4. All information classed as reported was obtained from the well owner or driller.
