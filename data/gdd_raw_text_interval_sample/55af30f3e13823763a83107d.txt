ABSTRACT
Reports from villagers living in the area of the northern part of the Lakhi Range suggest that coal had been mined in the mountains northwest of the Lakhra Anticline sometime within the past 100 years. The region in question lies 30 km northwest of Pakistan's largest coal field. Since the same strata that are mined for coal on the Lakhra Anticline are exposed in the northern Lakhi Range, these mountains, as well as some ridges to the west, may be regarded as potential coal prospects. This reconnaissance study was initiated to evaluate the coal resource potential of the coal-bearing Bara Formation in the area of Fort Ranikot in the Lakhi Range.
Coal was not found in the Bara rocks at Fort Ranikot. However, five rooted carbonaceous shales that may have been the residuum from weathered high ash coals were found. The two thickest of these carbonaceous shale beds were 1.20 m and 0.95 m. Five other rooted intervals were also identified. In the area of the Lakhra Anticline, rooted intervals are almost always associated with coal beds or carbonaceous shale, though this correlation may not hold at Fort Ranikot. Six covered intervals were observed. Because covered intervals typically occur in shaly zones, there is the possibility that additional rooted intervals, carbonaceous shales, or coal beds may have been obscured.
Structural complications may also have been a major factor in obscuring potential coal beds. The section was measured across the flanks of the most compressed part of the anticline. In similar structural settings elsewhere in the world, the compressional forces may mobilize the coal and squeeze it from the flanks. A more comprehensive assessment of the coal potential of the Bara Formation at Fort Ranikot will require investigations of the much less deformed strata in the western part of Lakhi Range and

perhaps one or two well placed drill holes. The Lakhi Range is the only place in Pakistan where the complete
thickness of the coal-bearing Bara Formation can be studied. Elsewhere in Pakistan this formation lies in the subsurface and is unstudied below its uppermost 250 m. The lithologic, sedimentologic and stratigraphic data derived from this study significantly improves our understanding of the regional stratigraphy of this formation and the depositional environments in which it accumulated. A better understanding of the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Bara Formation will contribute to increased efficiency in coal exploration in south Sindh.
We are of the opinion that a complete section of the Bara Formation was measured in Fort Ranikot in the Lakhi Range. This section was 486 m thick. However, because of the structural complexities in this area, it is possible that the section was faulted, and that a substantial, undetermined thickness of Bara is missing.

INTRODUCTION
The Bara Formation contains most of Sindh's known coal resources and supplies most of province's coal production from mines located on the crest of the Lakhra Anticline (figs.l, 2). From a geologic perspective, there is no a priori reason to suppose that the occurrence of coal in the Bara Formation is confined to the area of the Lakhra Anticline, a conclusion confirmed by the recent discovery of coal in the Thar Desert (SanFilipo and others, 1992). But, with the exception of the Thar drilling, exploration for coal has been restricted to the Lakhra Anticline and to areas no more than 80 km southwest, south, and southeast of Hyderabad (Landis and others, 1988; Schweinfurth and Husain, 1988), even though oil and gas drilling records suggest that coal is geographically widespread in the Bara Formation.
The Bara Formation occurs in the subsurface throughout most of Sindh (Quadri and Shuaib, 1986), but outcrops of this formation are rare. Surface exposures are confined to small occurrences of the uppermost non-coalbearing 10 to 20 m of the Bara on the crest of the Lakhra Anticline and in the banks of the Indus River near Jherruck and Daduri (fig. 2). Using aerial photographs, the Hunting Survey Corporation (1961) mapped Ranikot Group strata (which may include some Bara Formation) between the Bera and Daphro East Ridges and in the Daphro West Ridge west of Fort Ranikot. However, the only major exposure of Bara Formation occurs in the Lakhi Range where the whole thickness of the unit is exposed in places. Since COALREAP drilling has never penetrated more than the uppermost 250 m of the Bara Formation, the Lakhi Range is the only area in Sindh in which the coal resource potential of the middle and lower parts of the 500 - 1000 m thick Bara Formation can be assessed. This report is a preliminary assessment of the stratigraphy,

sedimentology, and coal resource potential of the Lakhi Range in the vicintity of Fort Ranikot. This study site was chosen because of its relative accessibility compared to other parts of the Lakhi Range and because of the presence of an apparently complete section of the Bara Formation at the site. Analysis of the Fort Ranikot section provides stratigraphic, lithologic, and sedimentologic data that cannot be obtained elsewhere in Sindh. This study contains the first description and characterization of the thick sandstones separating coal zones, and consequently, is a critical contribution to the stratigraphy of the Bara Formation. Previously, the nature of these sandstones was unknown because they were never recovered during drilling. The stratigraphic and sedmentologic data contained within this report will significantly improve regional facies models thereby improving the efficiency of coal exploration in this part of Sindh.
No coal was found in Fort Ranikot though several carbonaceous shales were seen. However, surficial weathering and structural complications along the line of section may have obscured potential coal occurrences. Carbonaceous shales were common as well as evidence in the form of rooted horizons of repeated episodes of terrestrial exposure. Further south in the area of the Lakhra Anticline rooted zones are almost exclusively associated with coal beds (Wnuk and others, 1993). Additional fieldwork will be needed to determine accurately if coal occurs in the northern part of the Lakhi Range.
This study was undertaken in March 1990 under the auspices of the Coal Resource Exploration and Assessment Program (COALREAP), a project agreement between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Geological Survey of

Pakistan (GSP), and the Government of Pakistan (GOP). Establishing a National Coal Exploration Plan (NCEP) and implementing a coal resource assessment program which includes exploration guided by the recommendations of the NCEP are two of the primary missions of the PASA agreement between the USGS and USAID.
BACKGROUND
In 1985, P.O. Simon participated in a reconnaissance survey that attempted to locate old coal mine workings that were reported to occur by villagers living in the northern part of the Lakhi Range. The attempt was unsuccessful (P.O. Simon, oral communication, 1989). In April 1989, SanFilipo and Wnuk, along with members of the faculty from the University of Sindh made reconnaissance surveys of the Bara Formation type section (fig. 2) at Bara Dhoro and the principal reference section (fig. 3) at Fort Ranikot. Although no evidence of abandoned coal workings were found, they determined that the Bara Formation had some coal potential which merited more detailed investigation. Hence, this study. In 1990, the authors and Elizabeth Brouwers of the USGS, and S. Farah Fatmi of GSP attempted to make reconnaissance surveys for Bara Formation sediments in the ridges west of the Lakhi Range. The travel time to these areas was lengthy but the region was accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles; however, because of the lack of time during that trip, it could not determined if the Bara Formation is actually exposed in any of those western ridges as reported by Blanford (1879) .

REGIONAL STRATIGRAPHY
The generalized stratigraphy of Paleocene and lower Eocene strata in the Lakhra Anticline, approximately 30 km southeast of Fort Ranikot is shown in figure 4. According to Cheema and others (1977), the Khadro Formation contains the oldest Paleocene rocks. Cheema and others (1977) indicate that the formation consists of beds of greenish- and yellow-brown, poorly cemented, dirty, calcareous and ferruginous, medium-grained sandstone, olive shale and siltstone, and thin, brown, fossiliferous, argillaceous limestone. At any place within the Lakhi Range, between 1 and 3 basalt beds may be exposed in the Khadro. Blanford (1878), Cheema and others (1977), and Ahmed and Siddiqui (unpublished data) place the contact between the Bara and Khadro Formations on the top of the highest basalt unit. Other workers place all of the basalt units in the basal 50 m of the Bara Formation (Farshori, unpublished data; Abdullah, unpublished data). In this report, we will follow the conventions of Cheema and others (1977) with regard to the Khadro-Bara contact. The Khadro Formation is 67 m thick in its type area, Khadro Dhoro in the Lakhi Range, and is reported in Cheema and others (1977) to be 140 m thick in the Lakhra Anticline. The overlying Paleocene Bara Formation (fig. 4) consists of beds of white or gray sandstone, that weather white, gray, red, purple, or maroon. The sandstone is poorly cemented, clean or dirty, non-calcareous, and fine- to coarse-grained. Approximately 40 percent of the formation consists of beds of gray siltstone and claystone that weather brown or maroon. In the Lakhra area, 1 to 2 percent of the formation consists of coal beds. The Bara Formation contains the majority of the known coal resources in Sindh. The Bara Formation ranges in thickness from more than 1,000 m in the

Karachi Trough 50 km southwest of the Lakhra Anticline (Quadri and Shuaib, 1986) to less than 60 m in the northern part of the Sulaiman Range, Balochistan (Williams, 1959). Cheema and others (1977), Anmed and Siddiqui (unpublished data), and Farshori (unpublished data) report widely divergent thicknesses for the Bara Formation at the principal reference section at Fort Ranikot. Cheema and others (1977) state that the Bara Formation is 600 m thick, Anmed and Siddiqui (unpublished) indicate that the Formation is 355 m thick, and Farshori (unpublished) indicates a formation thickness of 305 m. This paper reports a Bara thickness of 486 m. The reasons for these discrepancies are unknown. The Paleocene Lakhra Formation (fig. 4) consists of beds of green or greengray sandstone and gray siltstone and claystone that weather yellow-brown, olive, brown, maroon, or red. The sandstone is poorly cemented, clean or dirty, fine- to medium-grained, and calcareous or non-calcareous. Limestone beds generally account for less than 20 percent of the section, although in places limestone or coquina is the dominant lithology. The Lakhra Formation is 400 m thick in the Karachi Trough (Quadri and Shuaib, 1986) and 194 m thick on the Lakhra Anticline (Wnuk, Fariduddin, and others, 1991) . There are conflicting reports concerning the thickness and distribution of the Lakhra Formation north of the Lakhra Anticline. The Hunting Survey Corporation (1961) has indicated that the Upper Ranikot (Lakhra) Formation is not present in the Lakhi Range. Cheema and others (1977) disagree with the Hunting Survey assessment, stating that the Lakhra is present in the Lakhi Range, but they indicated that the Lakhra Formation is absent in the Fort Ranikot area. Anmed and Siddiqui (unpublished data), and Farshori (unpublished data) report the presence of at least 50 m of Lakhra Formation in the Fort Ranikot area. Wnuk, Fariduddin, and others (1991) show the
11

Lakhra thinning northward from the core of the Lakhra Anticline. Consequently, the absence of Lakhra strata at the principal reference section, which is approximately 30 km north of the crest of the Lakhra Anticline would be a reasonable consequence of the observed thinning trends within the Formation.
The terms Bara Formation and Ranikot Group are often used interchangeably within this report. The stratigraphic nomenclature of the Paleocene strata in Sindh is confused. The Hunting Survey maps do not actually identify a Bara Formation, rather they map the undivided Ranikot Group consisting of, from bottom to top, the Cardita beaumonti beds, the Lower Ranikot Formation, and the Upper Ranikot Formation. Current stratigraphic usage by the Geological Survey of Pakistan is summarized by Cheema and others (1977). They rename the three Hunting subdivisions, from bottom to top, as the Khadro Formation (after Williams, 1959), the Bara Formation, and the Lakhra Formation. Among geologists from the oil industry, the term Ranikot Formation is used by some authors for the Bara Formation only while the Lakhra Formation is correlated to the Dungan Formation of Balochistan (Williams, 1959). Other authors use the term Ranikot Formation to include the Khadro, Bara, and Lakhra Formations (Quadri and Shuaib, 1986). The Paleocene Sohnari Formation (fig. 4) of Outerbridge and others (1991) consists of beds of gray and white sandstone, and gray siltstone and claystone that weather maroon, red, purple, and sometimes gray and white. Where the formation is thin, it usually consists of beds of very indurated gray claystone that weathers to a distinctive red color. Beds of coal and shale-pebble conglomerate occur in places. Up to 5 percent of the Sonhari section thickness may be coal but economic coal deposits are only known to
12

occur in the area between Meting and Jhimpir (fig. 2). The formation is up to 58 m thick south of the Lakhra Anticline but may be absent in the Lakhi Range (Wnuk, SanFilipo, and others, 1991).
The Paleocene-Eocene Laki Formation (Usmani, 1983) consists of beds of light gray limestone interbedded with olive colored shale. The nomenclature for this formation is confused, but an overview of the naming conventions can be obtained from Cheema and others (1977), Ahmed and others (1984) and Outerbridge and others (1991). The Laki Formation ranges in thickness from 600 m at the southern end of the Lakhra Anticline to 240 m in the northern part of the Lakhi Range (Cheema and others, 1977).
METHODS
The Fort Ranikot section (Appendix 1 and fig. 5) was measured in March 1990, with a brunton and Jacob's staff. Approximately 537.55 m of section were measured in three offset sections (fig. 3), RN-1A, IB, and 1C. Subtracting 51.7 m of overlap between the offset sections, the total measured thickness of the Bara Formation was 485.85 m, from the top of the basalt to the contact with the overlying Laki Formation. Of the total measured section thickness, 42.30 m, or approximately 8 percent of the section was covered. Section RN-1A had the greatest amount of covered interval, 30.10 m of the total 163.26 m (18 percent), section RN-1B contained 12.20 m of covered interval of the total section length of 175.81 m (7 percent), and there were no covered intervals in section RN-lC which was 197.48 m thickO.
The section was sampled and examined by the paleontologists S. Farah Fatmi from the Geological Survey of Pakistan and Elizabeth Brouwers from the U.S. Geological Survey. They collected 14 samples for palynological and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Bara Formation is exposed in the core of the north to northnortheast trending, anticlinal Lakhi Range (fig. 6). The anticline is asymmetrical with the western flank being much broader than the eastern flank. Maximum dips around the core of the anticline are 65 degrees. The western flank flattens to less than 10 degrees 300 m from the axial trace. The Bara Formation was measured in the east flank of the anticline because it is better exposed there. The formation is mostly covered in the western flank due to the gentler dips.
There are several structural complications in the measured section. Bedding-plane faults were detected in some shale beds. Also, some of the thinner shaly intervals (5 m or less) between thick sandstone units varied in thickness by 100 percent over distances as short as 100 m. For comparison, similar shaly zones in the less deformed western flank of the anticline maintain approximately uniform thickness over distances approaching 1 km. Both the bedding-plane faults and the apparent flow of the shales are interpreted as structural readjustment of the strata caused by the folding. Until a section of the Bara Formation is measured in the less deformed western flank of the anticline, there is no way to estimate how much the shaly intervals on the measured section may have been thinned by faulting and flowage.
One reverse fault cuts section RN-1A. The fault is subparallel to bedding and occurs in one of the clean sandstone units. We were unable to

determine the amount of movement on this fault, but because there is no structural deformation (drag folding) of the strata along the fault trace and because the fault is subparallel to bedding we believe that this fault does not significantly alter the thickness of the section.
The Hunting Survey (1961) maps (Geological Map No. 6, Thano Bula Khan and Geological Map No. 11, Bela) show multiple faults between the Laki Limestone and the underlying formations in the northern part of the Lakhi Range and at least one fault between the Laki and Ranikot Groups in the southern part of the Lakhi Range. Abdullah (1980) has shown that the faults mapped by the Hunting Survey in the northern half of the Lakhi Range (between 26°00' and 26°15' N, on Geological Map No. 11, Bela) are thrust faults. A reconnaissance survey by us to Bara Dhoro (fig. 2) in 1989 to visit the Bara Formation type section confirmed Abdullah's observations. From the Hunting Survey map of the Fort Ranikot area (26-00' to 25-45' N, Geological Map No. 6, Thano Bula Khan) a thrust fault would be presumed to separate the Laki Formation from the Ranikot Group as well. However, on traversing Ranikot Dhoro across the fault trace indicated on the Hunting maps, no evidence of a fault crossing the stream was found by us. On a northward traverse up the first tributary west of the Ranikot Fort wall, bedding irregularities and dip changes indicative of a fault were seen, but the scale and intensity of the observed deformation appeared too little to have been caused by a major thrust. No bedding disturbances were observed south of Ranikot Dhoro where the section RN-1C was measured. A box fold (fig. 7) within the Laki Limestone was seen on an eastward traverse to the Fort Ranikot gateway. If this structure is interpreted as a drag fold, the plane of the thrust fault mapped by the Hunting Survey would appear to pass through the Laki Limestone in this area and the Laki-Bara contact may.

therefore, be undisturbed. Because of the apparent absence of major structural deformation along
the lines of measured section, we are of the opinion that the measured section encompasses the complete Bara Formation. There are, however, some stratigraphic anomalies in the Bara-Laki succession in this area that may yet prove to be structurally controlled. These will be discussed below.
The Laki-Bara contact is covered at the top of Section RN-1C, but it is exposed 300 m to the north. There, light-gray, rooted underclays are in direct contact with the Laki Limestone. The stratigraphic succession is similar to the Laki-Sohnari transition some 30 km to the south-southeast in the Lakhra Anticline described by Wnuk, SanFilipo, and others, (1991) except that the rooted zone is not as intensely leached as are root zones in the Sohnari further to the south (though this has yet to be confirmed by chemical analysis). Also the very distinctive breccia-like claystone texture and bright red coloration of the Sohnari in Lakhra are absent at Fort Ranikot.
Characteristic Lakhra lithologies are also absent. This observation is in contradiction to the results of Ahmed and Siddiqui (unpublished data) who reported approximately 50 m of Lakhra strata topping approximately the same section as ours. Their criteria for distinguishing between the Lakhra and Bara Formations is unclear. Their section description indicates that the Lakhra and Bara Formations are lithologically identical. Analysis of their stratigraphic column and descriptions suggests that they make the distinction on the basis of the first appearance of shell remains. However, south of the Lakhi Range, Lakhra shell assemblages typically contain well preserved Turritella and other gastropods, forams, crinoids, bivalves, crustaceons, echinoderms, and corals in well exposed beds. We did not
19

observe any shell remains in this section although the Bara is known to contain low diversity assemblages of thin-shelled bivalves, gastropods and forams in Lakhra and areas to the south (Wnuk and others, 1992). Ahmed and Siddiqui (unpublished data) also report that plant fossils occur within the section that they identified as Lakhra at Fort Ranikot. The detailed studies of the Lakhra Formation in Lakhra by Wnuk, Fariduddin, and others (1991) show that the Lakhra Formation does not contain plant fossils, and that it tends to be low in organic debris in general. Furthermore, the Lakhra formation weathers to a very characteristic yellow-brown color in the areas where it is exposed south and east of the Lakhi Range. We attribute this coloration to the chemical decomposition of glauconite that is abundant in the Lakhra Formation drill core. Similarly colored, yellow-brown sediments were not observed on the east flank of the anticline in the Fort Ranikot section. Yellow-brown rocks were seen below the Laki Limestone in the western flank of the anticline, but these rocks could not be studied during either 1989 or 1990 so it is not known if they represent Lakhra strata. On the basis of these several observations, it is our opinion that the Lakhra Formation is absent at the Fort Ranikot area.
Various explanations can account for the apparent absence of the Lakhra and Sohnari Formations including: 1) a fault causing the juxtaposition of the Laki Formation against the Bara Formation; 2) an unconformity that removed the Sohnari and Lakhra Formations, and possibly even the top of the Bara Formation; or 3) non-deposition of the Sohnari and/or Lakhra Formations over a local topographic high. Because there is no clear evidence of a fault between the Laki and the Bara Formations in the area of the measured section, the first explanation appears to be incorrect. However, if Lakhra rocks are found in the western flank, the first
20

explanation will need to be reconsidered. Without additional stratigraphic studies in the Lakhi Range, it is difficult to choose between the second and third stratigraphic alternatives and their various permutations. At first inspection, the presence of a Bara-like (rather than an intensely weathered and leached Sohnari-like) rooted seat earth in contact with the Laki Limestone may be taken as evidence of an erosional unconformity between the Laki and the underlying strata. According to this interpretation the Sohnari, Lakhra, and a part of the Bara Formations were eroded prior to the deposition of the Laki Limestone. However, the concurrent northward thinning of both the Sohnari and Lakhra Formations documented by Wnuk, SanFilipo, and others (1991) and Wnuk, Fariduddin, and others (1991) in the area of the Lakhra Anticline is more consistent with the third alternative - that the Sohnari and Lakhra thin and pinch-out over a pre-existing high. Alternatively, Outerbridge and others (1991) have suggested that the Sohnari is a tongue of the Bara. The implication in the Fort Ranikot area is that the Lakhra Formation may pinch-out while the Sohnari and Bara Formations coalesce.
No lignites were exposed in the Ranikot section, but three factors may explain the apparent lack of coal. First, in the Lakhra and Sonda coal fields, lignites are found in the fine-grained facies that occur between the thick, clean, sandstone units (SanFilipo and others, 1988). At Fort Ranikot, six intervals were mostly covered and their detailed lithology could not be determined. Based on small exposures and weathering characteristics, these intervals are interpreted to consist primarily of fine-grained sediments. Second, the section was measured across the area of tightest folding and there is some evidence that fine-grained rocks (which would include the beds of lignite) may have been squeezed out as a result of the deformation.
21

Third, weathering may have obscured thinner lignite beds. On the Lakhra Anticline weathering effects are known to penetrate as deeply as 30 m below the surface so we made no attempt to excavate covered parts of the section.
Ten rooted intervals were found in the Fort Ranikot section (Table 1). Wnuk and others (1993) note that 41 of 47 rooted intervals (87 percent) in the Bara Formation strata penetrated by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation test hole (designated THL, fig. 2) are immediately overlain by a coal or carbonaceous shale bed. The 6 rooted zones not overlain by coal in the test hole are instead in erosive contact with an overlying sandstone bed. The coals were probably eroded prior to or as a consequence of the deposition of these sandstones. The presence of rooted zones at Fort Ranikot suggests that the coal potential of this area should not be discounted until additional studies are made, especially given the strong association between rooted zones and coal and carbonaceous shale beds in the Bara Formation occurring in the other areas drilled in south Sindh.
Rooted zones occur throughout the Bara section at Fort Ranikot, although they are most abundant in the upper two-thirds of the formation. This distribution of rooting differs significantly from root distribution in the PMDC THL hole where rooted strata occur only in the upper 260 m of the 565 m of Bara that were penetrated in that hole (Wnuk, and others, 1993). A bed of carbonaceous shale overlying a rooted underclay was exposed 18.45 m above the base of the Bara Formation in a cut bank of Ranikot Dhoro in section RN-1C. The shale was relatively unweathered. Palynological analysis of sample EB-90-88 indicates that it may be from the oldest preserved Paleocene terrestrial facies in the Bara Formation. Although the results of the analysis are not definitive, they are not inconsistent with a Danian age (Frederiksen, written communication, 1992). This lower zone did not appear

to have coal potential in this area; however, the occurrence of terrestrial have potential for coal elsewhere in Sindh.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Because field time was very limited, this investigation had to be a reconnaissance survey. The primary objective of this study was to measure and describe as complete a section of the Bara Formation as possible, because existing descriptions of both the type section and the principal reference section lack detail and the measurements are contradictory. We hoped to return to this area at a later date to consider the structural complexities. However, a return proved to be impossible due to security requirements stemming from an armed attack on one of our field parties. Consequently, a number of unresolved structural questions persist. Accurately determining whether the Sohnari, Lakhra, and Bara Formations thin, thicken, are faulted, or eroded in the Lakhi Range has significant implications for future coal exploration in the Fort Ranikot area. According to the data published in the Hunting Survey maps (Hunting Survey, 1961), the Bara Formation underlies at least 600 sq km of the Lakhi Range. This is an area comparable in size to the area currently producing coal on the Lakhra Anticline. If coal is present in the Bara Formation in the Lakhi Range, it may be accessible by mining directly into the Bara Formation exposed in the western flank of the Lakhi Anticline and possibly in the ridges west of the Lakhi Range. If the Sohnari and Lakhra Formations are thinned or absent, Bara Formation coal beds may also be accessible by shaft in areas where the overlying Laki Formation (which Cheema and others (1977) report to be up to 240 m thick in this area) has been thinned by erosion.
26

The measurements of the section in the Fort Ranikot area must be considered preliminary. There are enough questions about the geology of the Bara Formation strata around the Fort to justify additional work there. More work must be done to resolve the disparities in the reported thicknesses of the Bara Formation and to confirm the apparent absence of the Lakhra Formation and Sohnari Formation in this region.
Excellent exposures of the Bara Formation can be found in many places throughout the Lakhi Range. In order to obtain a more complete understanding of the coal potential of the Fort Ranikot area and the facies characteristics and variability of the Bara Formation, a series of sections should be measured over the length of the Lakhi Range.
The numerous carbonaceous shales and rooted intervals suggest that this area has a coal potential, and a surficial geologic survey can go far to evaluate this potential. However, surficial and structural processes tend to obscure the coal beds, so one or two well placed drill holes will be needed to more definitively evaluate the coal prospects of this area.
According to the Hunting Survey maps, Ranikot (probably Bara Formation) rocks are also exposed between the Bera and the Daphro East Ridges directly west of Fort Ranikot, and in a small outlier in the Daphro West Ridge. These areas are accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles and should be included in a follow-up study.
The Hunting Survey maps indicate that there are Laki Formation outliers west of the Daphro West Ridge. Though these outliers appear to be severely faulted and folded and probably would be difficult to mine, if a coal resources are eventually proven to occur in the Lakhi Range, then the rocks under these far western Laki outcrops may also become prospective for coal.

END OF SECTION

The exact correlation between section RN-1B and RN-1C was not determined in the field. Unit 76 in section RN-1B is believed to correlate approximately to Unit 2 in section RN-1C. However, a best fit correlation will be needed between RN-1B and RN-1C because the exact correlation could not be determined in the field.
