levels in late fall. Wells in the southwestern part of the Rathdrum Valley are sufficiently distant from the lake that their water levels are influenced chiefly by regional ground-water recharge
factors. Figure 17 is a long-term hydrograph for well 53N 4W-24bbl, about 10 miles southwest of Pend Oreille Lake. The water level in the well declined only about 0. 5 foot during 1954; the net rise since the start of a wet cycle in 1941 remained at about 16 feet. Artificial regulation of Pend Oreille Lake, holding it several feet higher than its natural maximum level, probably has increased ground-water recharge to the Rathdrum Valley by increased underflow from the lake. Thus ground-water levels may remain slightly higher than formerly, and the range of their fluctua-
tions may be lessened.

The water level-in Latah County well 39N 5W-7ddl, a nonflowing artesian well in the Moscow Basin, declined about 4 feet net, continuing the downward trend that began many years ago. In well 39N 5W-10acl, a shallow water-table well east of the Moscow Basin, the water level declined about 1 foot.

In the Malad Valley of Oneida County, 8 of 28 observed wells reached record-low levels, but well 15S 35E-12ab2 attained a record high. Of 21 wells with long-term records, water levels
in 17 wells ranged from about 0. 3 foot to 11 feet below the 1953 year-end levels; in 4 wells water levels were about 0. 7 foot to 9 feet above the 1953 year-end levels. The generally lower water levels in the Malad Valley, where most of the wells are artesian, may result from below-normal precipitation during 1953 and 1954. Differences between the net changes of water levels in various wells and differing departures from average are partly a result of local pumpage and discharge by flowing wells. Wells in the Malad Valley characteristically reach their highest levels during the period February to April. The ground-water hydrology of the Malad Valley is complex, and no simple explanation will account for all water-level fluctuations.

The water level in well 7N 5W-3dal in the Payette Valley of Payette County did not change from 1953, although precipitation in 1954 was considerably below the 1953 total. Effects of local
precipitation on water-level fluctuations in this well are masked by the effects of artificial recharge from irrigation.

During 1954 the following wells were discontinued as observation wells: wells 3N IW-lccl, 3N IW-lOccl, and 3N lE-4bal in Ada County; well 3N 2W-23dcl in Canyon County; wells 10S 23E-20dcl, and 10S 23E-20dc3 in Cassia County; and well 4N 37E-28bbl in Jefferson County.

Water-level fluctuations in 1954 in observation wells with 10 or more years of record are summarized in the following tables:

WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURES IN OBSERVATION WELLS IN THE UNITED STATES
IN 1954

Part 5. NORTHWESTERN STATES

INTRODUCTION By A. N. Sayre

The publication of records of water levels and artesian pressures annually in the United States was begun by the Geological Survey in 1935. Prior to 1940 the records for each year were published in a single volume 1935, 777; 1936, 817; 1937, 840; 1938, 845; 1939, 886. Since 1940 records have been published in six annual volumes, covering the northeastern, southeastern, north-central, south-central, northwestern, and southwestern sections of the country. Hawaii is included in the southwestern section. The following table gives the numbers of Water-Supply Papers from 1940 through 1954.

The objectives of the observation-well program are to provide a day-to-day evaluation of available ground-water supplies, to facilitate the prediction of trends in ground-water levels that will indicate the probable status of important ground-water supplies in the future, to delineate present or potential areas of detrimentally high or low ground-water levels, to aid in the prediction of the base flow of streams, to determine the several forces that act on a ground-water body, and to demonstrate the interplay of those forces in the ground-water regimen, to furnish information for use in basic research, and to provide long-term continuous records of fluctuations of water levels in representative wells. These selected records serve as a framework to which many short-term records collected during an intensive investigation may be related.

Water levels in wells are seldom stationary but move up or down a fraction of an inch or many feet within a short time. Water-table wells may be influenced by direct recharge from precipitation, withdrawals from wells or springs, transpiration by vegetation, evaporation from the soil, and changes in atmospheric pressure. Artesian wells are influenced over large areas by changes in the rate of pumping from other wells, changes in atmospheric pressure,
earthquakes, ocean tides, earth tides, and recharge from precipitation, although the recharge may not be noticeable immediately. When accurate comparisons of water levels are made it is desirable to apply corrections for these influences, several of which may be compensating or additive according to the conditions at those particular times.

WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURES, 1954, NORTHWESTERN STATES Water-level measurements are given in feet with reference to land-surface datum or sealevel datum. Land-surface datum is a precise datum plane that is about at land surface at each well. Mean sea level (msl) is the datum plane on which the national network of precise levels is based. When some measurements in a table are above and others are below the plane of reference, a plus (+) or minus (-) sign is placed before the first entry in each column. Readings between minus signs are below the plane of reference and those between plus signs are above the plane of reference. For the most part, discussions of precipitation in this report are based on data furnished by the U. S. Weather Bureau. Measurements of water levels and artesian pressures in wells were made under the direction of the district supervisors of the Ground Water Branch in the several States.

edited the illustrations.

Scope of Water-Level Program
The observation-well program in Colorado was continued in 1954 in cooperation with the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station. Measurements were made in 246 wells, 5 of which were equipped with recording gages. Figures 2-10 show the location of observation wells in the State. Water levels in 143 wells were measured by W. E. Code of the Agricultural Experiment Station.
Precipitation
Precipitation in Colorado was about normal in July and September and was below normal during the remainder of the year. Precipitation during February and April was at an alltime low for these months.
Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
Water levels have declined throughout the State. Water levels in the majority of observation wells in Adams, Arapahoe, El Paso, Huerfano, Larimer, Morgan, Otero, Pueblo, Sedgwick, Washington, and Weld Counties declined to record lows, and some record lows were established in Elbert and Logan Counties. Pumpage of ground water for irrigation has increased rapidly, owing to below-normal precipitation and to the consequent decrease in surface-water supplies normally used for that purpose. For this reason, not only have water levels in the tributary valleys of the South Platte continued to decline at a serious rate, but also water levels in the main stem and in major tributary valleys, where normally surface water is applied for irrigation, have declined at an accelerated rate. Water levels in the Arkansas Basin continued to decline, in general, even though water levels in a few observation wells in Baca and Huerfano Counties reached new highs. Water levels in San Luis Valley, in general, declined slightly, although thtere were slight to moderate rises in some wells.
Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. The first letter of a well number gives the quadrant of the meridian and baseline system, beginning in the northeast quadrant (A) and proceeding counterclockwise. All wells in Colorado lie in the northwest (B) and southwest (C) quadrants of the 6th principal meridian and 40th parallel baseline system. The first segment of a well number indicates the township, the second the range, and the third the section. The lowercase letters a, b, c, and d after the section number locate the well within the section. The first letter denotes the 160-acre tract, the second letter the 40-acre tract, and the third letter the 10-acre tract.

IDAHO
By G. E. Brandvold, H. G. Sisco, and R. H. Carson
Scope of Water - Level Program
The observation-well program in Idaho has been continuous since 1946 in cooperation with the State Department of Reclamation. Measurements in observation wells in the Rathdrum Valley, Kootenai County, were made in collaboration with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and in the Snake River plain in collaboration with the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Bureau of Reclamation. Special investigations on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission, begun in 1949, were continued in the central Snake River plain. An areal study in the western Snake River plain was continued as a noncooperative Federal project. An appraisal study of ground-water resources of the upper Big Wood River-Silver Creek area in Blaine County was begun in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Reclamation. At the end of the year, measurements were being made in 86 observation wells in 16 of the 44 counties in Idaho. Ten recording gages and two nonrecording gages were operated throughout 1954. Figures 11-14 show the location of observation wells in the State.
The following mimeographed report was released to the open file in 1954: Records of wells, water-level fluctuations, and ground-water withdrawals in the Aberdeen-Springfield area, Bingham and Power Counties, Idaho, by Harold G. Sisco.
Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
Observation wells in the Boise Valley of Ada and Canyon Counties are in a heavily irrigated area of about 350 square miles. The effects of local precipitation on water-level fluctuations in the valley are largely masked by the effects of artificial recharge from excess irrigation water from the Boise River. Drainage canals and pumped drainage wells also introduce local complications in water-level fluctuations. Although precipitation in the area during 1954 was below normal and considerably below that of 1953, 3 of the 7 wells reported in the valley reached new high levels. The rise in water levels probably was caused largely by increased applications of irrigation water during the abnormally dry spring and summer. Figure 15 shows long-term water-level records for wells 4N lW-36dal and 3N 2W-25aal that are representative of wells in the irrigated part of the Boise Valley. Boise County well 7N 2E-34cal fluctuated within its normal range, but the year-end water level was 2. 5 feet below that of 1953, indicating deficient recharge from below-normal precipitation during the year. This well, in a mountain valley area, represents the natural ground-water storage that maintains-the dry-season flow of local streams.
There was no appreciable change in the water level in Bonneville County well 3N 41E-6cbl, near the edge of an extensive irrigated area in the eastern Snake River plain. Figure 16 is a hydrograph of the well.
Wells in the Raft River valley, Cassia County, ranged below normal and showed appreciable net decreases in ground-water storage. Water levels in 6 of the 8 wells reported reached recordlow levels in 1954. This was a result of below-normal precipitation on the watershed and increased withdrawals of ground water for new irrigation developments. Records of new drilling in the area during 1953 and 1954 are not complete, but it is estimated that ground-water withdrawals in 1954 did not exceed 30,000 acre-feet. Well 13S 22E-9dcl, in the Oakley Valley, Cassia County, is in an area of currently increasing ground-water use. The water level in the well ranged considerably below normal, and the net decline during the year was about 12 feet. The net decline was caused partly by below-normal precipitation and partly by increased draft on ground water for irrigation development. Irrigation withdrawals in 1954 were estimated to be about 15,000 acre-feet.
The water level in Jefferson County well 5N 34E-9dbl fluctuates in response to changes in barometric pressure, as well as to other factors. The barometric efficiency of the well is about 60 percent, but the water levels listed in this report have not been adjusted for barometric effects.
In the Rathdrum Valley of Kootenai County, water levels were generally above average at the end of 1954. In the northeastern part of the Rathdrum Valley, near Pend Oreille Lake, water levels in wells formerly attained their highest levels in late spring when the stage of the lake was at its maximum. Since July 1952, however, the stage of the lake has been regulated by Albeni Falls Dam on the Pend Oreille River. Water levels in wells near the lake now reach their highest

Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. The first segment indicates the township, the second the range, and the third the section in which the well is situated. The lowercase letters, a, b, c, and d, after the section number indicate the well location within the section: the first letter denotes the 160-acre tract, the second the 40-acre tract, and the third the 10-acre tract. The letters are assigned in a counterclockwise direction, beginning in the northeast quarter. Well 52N 4W-12cdbl is in theNWiSEiSWj sec. 12, T. 52 N., R. 4 W. The numeral following the third segment of the well number indicates the order in which the well was recorded.

By Frank A. Swenson

Scope of Water-Level Program
The observation of water-level fluctuations in wells in Montana was continued in 1954 in connection with ground-water studies being made as part of the program for development of the Missouri River Basin. Measurements of the water level in 23 wells are included in this report. The locations of the wells are shown in figure 18. Water levels for three wells are reported for the first time; these wells were established to replace nearby wells which were destroyed. Measurements of the water level in many other wells in the State are included in the reports on the project studies.
Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
The year 1954 was characterized by lack of extremes in water-level fluctuations. In five wells, the water level reached the lowest stage during the period of record, but it was only slightly lower than previous record lows. In three wells, the water level reached the highest stage during the period of record, but here too it was only slightly higher than previous highs.
Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. The first digit of a well number indicates the township, the second the range, and the third the section in which the well is situated. The first lowercase letter denotes the 160-acre tract and the second the 40-acre tract. The letters are assigned in a counterclockwise direction, beginning in the northeastern quarter. Well numbers are preceded by the capital letters, A, B, C, and D, to designate the location of the well in the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants, respectively, of the Montana principal meridian and baseline system. Thus, the number D-2-34-23ad indicates that the well so designated is in the SE^NEi sec. 23, T. 2 S., R. 34 E.

By Stuart G. Brown
Scope of Water-Level Program
The observation-well program in Oregon was continued in 1954 in cooperation with the State Engineer. Measurements for 100 wells are listed in this report, including 9 new wells in Yonna and Swan Lake Valleys (Klamath County) and 4 nonrecording gages. Measurements were discontinued in Linn County well 12/3W-9R1 and in Multnomah County well 2N/32-1Q1. Figures 19, 20, and 21 show the location of observation wells in western, central, and eastern Oregon, respectively. An investigation of ground-water conditions was begun in the East Portland and Multnomah County area and in the sand-dune area north of Coos Bay.
Precipitation
Precipitation for the State as a whole was 113 percent of the normal over the 1954 "water year." (A "water year" includes one wet season and the following dry season.) East of the Cascades, precipitation was 104 percent of normal; west of the Cascades, it was 122 percent of normal. The precipitation for the 1954 "water year" was computed at 17 stations. It ranged from 61 percent of normal in the Baker Valley to 130 percent of normal for The Poplars in the Fort Rock area. West of the Cascades, the highest deviation from normal occurred at Portland (126 percent of normal); the lowest occurred at Bandon (103 percent of normal). On a statewide basis, October was deficient in precipitation; the months of November, December, and January were normal or above normal. The months February through May were deficient, followed by a wet June, a deficient July, a wet August, and a deficient September.
Interpretation of'Water-Level Fluctuations
The State of Oregon is divided into 4 provinces and 12 subprovinces according to climate, topography, and the occurrence of ground water. (See Water-Supply Paper 1020 for a description of the ground-water areas.)
Measurements of water levels in observation wells in Oregon are made at various times of the year in order to show the effects of pumping and seasonal changes in ground-water storage. Measurements are made in early spring before heavy pumping begins, during the pumping season, and at the end of the pumping season. Midwinter measurements show the position of the groundwater level before the normal spring recharge is evident in many of the wells. Certain water levels, such as those in the Fort Rock Basin wells, of the Summer Lake subprovince in the southcentral part of the State, apparently lag the precipitation by a period of 8 to 10 years. Water levels in wells in the Walla Walla Basin in the northeastern part of the State show the passage of the ground water through the materials of the alluvial fan as a wave, commonly having a very sharp rise and slow drop to the end of the "water year." The water levels are interpreted in relation to the "water year" which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Thus, at the end of the "water year," comparisons are made of the net change in water levels for the September or October of the current year with those of September or October of the previous year. For some wells, it is necessary to interpolate the water levels at the end of the "water year."
Consistently higher-than-normal precipitation in the areas west of the Cascade Mountains resulted in higher water levels in September 1954 than in October 1953. Water levels east of the Cascades do not show such a trend, the precipitation and withdrawals being nonuniformly distributed.
Willamette Valley subprovince. --September-end 1954 water levels in the Willamette Valley in the western part of Oregon were on an average 0.97 foot higher than in 1953, in response to the above-normal summer precipitation and the consequent decrease of irrigation and transpiration withdrawals. Washington County well 1/1W-21R1, in an area of heavy withdrawal, declined 13.21 feet from December 1953 to September 1954. Wells in the Willamette Valley are listed under Benton, Lane, Linn, Marion, Multnomah, Washington, and Yamhill Counties. (See fig. 19.)

Deschutes River subprovince. In the Deschutes River subprovince in the north-central part of the State (fig. 20) Crook County well 14/15-15Q1 in the Prineville area, outside the area of heavy withdrawals from the artesian aquifer, was 1.0 foot higher in September 1954 than in 1953. Crook County well 14/16-32N1, in the area of heavy pumping in Prineville, was 2.39 feet higher in September 1954 than in October 1953. Water level in Crook County well 14/16-19H1, drawing its water from the shallower unconfined zone, was 1.90 feet higher in September 1954 than at the end of the 1953 "water year." The water levels in the artesian aquifer in the Prineville area recovered in the summer during the prolonged lumber mill shutdown.
John Day subprovince. Water-table wells in The Dalles area of the John Day subprovince in the north-central part of the State were on an average 5. 50 feet lower in September 1954 than in 1953. Wells in The Dalles area are listed under Wasco County. (See fig. 20.) The head on Wasco County artesian well 1N/13-32G1 declined 21 feet, owing to prolonged pumping from which the well had not fully recovered at the time of measurement. Precipitation at The Dalles was above normal from November through January; all but two of the other months were deficient.
Walla Walla subprovince. September levels in the wells near Milton-Freewater in the Walla Walla subprovince in the northeastern part of the State (fig. 21) showed an average 0.40foot higher stage than in 1953. Wells in the Walla Walla Basin are listed under Umatilla County. (See fig. 21.) The yearly high observed in Umatilla County well 6N/35-36H1 in May was 2. 56 feet above the high of May 1953. By contrast, the yearly peak discharge of the nearby Walla Walla River was 1,365 cfs (cubic feet per second) as compared to 1,450 cfs in 1953. The yearly precipitation at Milton was estimated to be about 97 percent average. February, May, and December were deficient; the other months were about normal.
Grande Ronde subprovince. Observation wells in the Grande Ronde subprovince in the northeastern part of the State are listed under Baker and Union Counties. In the Baker area of the Powder River valley, September water levels were 0.31 foot lower than the 1953 October levels. The highest water level of 1954 in Baker County well 8/39-22G1 in February was 1.01 foot lower than the 1953 high recorded in January. A record low was reached in this well in September. Precipitation in Baker Valley, 61 percent of normal, was the lowest recorded for any of the 17 stations for which it was computed. In the Grande Ronde Valley (Union County), September water levels were 0.23 foot lower than in October 1953.
Owyhee River subprovince. --The water levels in the two observation wells in the Cow Valley area of the Owyhee River subprovince in the southeastern part of the State, drawing on stored water in a closed basin, have declined an average of 3.24 feet since the end of the 1953 pumping season. This decline is consistent with continuous overdrafts there. Malheur County well 18/47-17D1 in the Malheur River valley near Ontario rose 1.30 feet from October 1953 to September 1954. The water level in this well in part reflects the amount of irrigation in the area. Precipitation at Vale, about 15 miles west of Ontario, was about 80 percent of normal. Malheur County well 21/38-17Q1 at Juntura declined 0.21 foot from October 1953 to September 1954. In the southern part of the Owyhee subprovince, water levels declined an average of 0.81 foot from October 1953 to October 1954. The precipitation at Danner was about 79 percent of normal.
Summer Lake subprovince. In the Fort Rock area of the Summer Lake subprovince in the south-central part of the State,there was a general rise of 0.18 foot in the levels in the watertable wells; however, Lake County well 28/14-23D1 showed a decline of 1.73 feet. The water level in Lake County well 27/15-4G1, an artesian well,rose to a new high in December 1954. Precipitation at The Poplars, 130 percent of normal, was the highest percentage deviation in the State. In the Chewaucan River valley, water levels were almost the same as in September 1953, the average net change being 0.08 foot.
In the Swan Lake and Yonna Valleys in Klamath County, water levels in wells tapping perched water declined an average of 0.23 foot; water-table wells declined an average of 0.18 foot; and artesian wells declined an average of 0.30 foot. (These are interpolated water levels.) Precipitation at Klamath Falls was 110 percent of normal. Water levels in some of these wells may reflect the heavy irrigation withdrawals during the summer months. Well 30/ll|-32Gl is used both as an irrigation well and as a recharge well, utilizing the field drainage and the irrigation waste water as recharge. About 100 acre-feet per year is thus recharged.
Harney Basin subprovince, --Water levels in wells tapping water in unconfined condition in the Burns area of the Harney Basin subprovince in the southeastern part of the State were the same as in September 1953. In Harney County well 23/31-33E1 the yearly high on June 13 was 0.25 foot lower than the high of May 17, 1953. Precipitation at Burns was slightly above average. Wells in the Warner Valley area showed an average decline of 1.10 feet. Lake County well 38/24-27M1, tapping water in an artesian condition, flowed intermittently. In previous years, its water level has been slightly below land surface. Precipitation at Lakeview was about 107 percent of normal.

Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. The segment before the hyphen indicates township and range; the one or two digits after the hyphen indicate the section; the letter indicates the 40-acre subdivision of the section, as shown in the diagram; and the final digit indicates the serial number of the well within the 40-acre tract. Locations in Oregon are referred to the Willamette baseline and meridian. If no letter appears after the township number, the township lies south of the baseline; if no letter appears after the range number, the range lies east of the meridian. Thus, well 3/38-25B1 is in the NWiNE| sec. 25, T. 3 S., R. 38 E., and is the first well listed in this tract.

Scope of Water - Level Program
The observation-well program in Utah, begun in 1935, was continued in 1954 in cooperation with the State Engineer. Investigations were continued and expanded in the principal pumping districts of southwestern Utah, namely, the Beryl-Enterprise and Milford districts of Escalante Valley, Cedar City Valley, and Parowan Valley. Detailed ground-water studies of the East Shore area in connection with the Weber Basin project were continued in 1954 in cooperation with the Bureau of Reclamation. A comprehensive ground-water study of the eastern part of the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County, begun in June 1953,was completed in August 1954. A field investigation of the geology and ground-water occurrence of the Navajo Lake vicinity in northwestern Kane County was begun in July 1954 as a part of a cooperative program with the Utah Water and Power Board and the city of Cedar City. A total of 3,234 static water-level measurements were made in 958 selected observation wells scattered through 42 ground-water areas. In addition, recording gages were maintained on 54 wells. The records of 276 of these observation wells, including 21 recording gages, are given in this report.
The records of other wells listed in previous annual reports may be examined in the open file at the Utah district office of the Ground Water Branch, U. S. Geological Survey, 503 Federal Building, Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, some records of water-level measurements are included in special project reports that are published separately. The water-level report does not include more than 1, 400 pumping measurements made in more than 400 irrigation wells during the pumping season.
The following table shows by counties and areas the number of observation wells measured in Utah and the number of recording gages maintained.

Effect of the current drought upon water supplies in Cedar City Valley, Utah, by H. A. Waite and H. E. Thomas. (Read at the 35th annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, May 3-5, by Mr. Thomas. Published in Transactions.)
Precipitation
In general, 1954 was one of the warmest and driest years on record. The drought conditions adversely affected ranges and summer water supplies, especially in the southern half of the State. The winter was the driest since 1931 and the fifth warmest since records began. The spring of 1954 was the driest and warmest since 1940, with the exception of the spring of 1950. Summer, although warmer and drier than usual, was not a recordbreaker in either regard. Above-normal precipitation in the fall of 1954 made it the wettest fall since 1947. Only five fall seasons have been warmer in the climatological history of the State. According to records of the U. S. Weather Bureau, the State average of 11.23 inches for 1954 was 1. 95 inches below normal for the period of record. The cumulative effects of high temperatures and below-normal precipitation have had a pronounced effect on the ground-water reservoirs of the State.
Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
In general, water levels in observation wells in the southern part of Utah have continued to decline during the past few years, in response to the drought that has prevailed in the southwestern part of the United States and the consequent accelerated use of ground water for irrigation. In the northern part of the State, water levels in most observation wells have not declined significantly during the past several years. The hydrographs of 14 selected observation wells are shown in figures 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26. The hydrographs of these wells have been selected as being representative of water-level trends that prevail throughout the State. Although significant seasonal variations in water level have been measured in each of these wells, only year-end readings have been used in these modified hydrographs to show annual changes in ground-water storage.
As noted in the hydrographs of Cache County well (A-12-l)29bdd-l in Cache Valley and Tooele County well (C-2-4)33add-l in Tooele Valley in northern Utah (fig. 22), water levels remained relatively constant or rose slightly during the periods of record. These wells are in the middle of large ground-water basins far removed from the direct effects of recharging mountain streams. Although there has been some increase in ground-water use in recent years, recharge from precipitation has been sufficient to offset this use. The water level in Salt Lake County well (D-2-l)4dbd-4 in Holladay declined in 1953 and 1954, but at the end of 1954 the water level was about 5 feet higher than during its lowest stage at the end of 1934.
The hydrographs of Box Elder County well (B-8-2)23cdb-l, Weber County well (B-5-2) 4cdd-l, and Davis County well (A-2-l)19dbc-l in the East Shore area are shown in figure 23. The water level in the Willard Water Co. well (B-8-2)23cdb-l declined slightly from 1946 through 1953. A decline of about 5 feet took place in 1954, but despite this, the water level was still more than 2 feet higher than it was at the beginning of record. The hydrographs of Weber County well (B-5-2)4cdd-l near Ogden and Davis County well (A-2-l)19dbc-l at Bountiful show alternately the effects of deficient precipitation during 1951 and the abnormally high spring runoff of 1952. The water levels in both of these wells declined sharply in 1954. The water level in well (B-5-2) 4cdd-l reached a new alltime year-end low at the close of 1954; the water level in well (A-2-1) 19dbc-l was the lowest year-end reading of its entire period of record. The pumping of several

UTAH

new wells in the immediate vicinity of the Bountiful observation well undoubtedly contributed to the water-level decline.
In two of the three wells whose hydrographs are shown in figure 24, the water levels declined during 1953 and 1954, but at the end of 1954 they were higher than they were at the beginning of their respective records. The water levels in Millard County well (C-21-5)21aba-l near Flowell and Sevier County well (C-23-2)19dab-l near Richfield rose significantly during the abnormally high runoff in 1952. The water level in well (C-23-2)19dab-l near Richfield has fluctuated as much as 20 feet during the past 19 years, and the net rise during this period amounted to about 11 feet.
The hydrographs of Sanpete County well (D-16-3)32ddc-2 near Ephraim and Beaver County well (C-29-10)6ddc-2 near Milford are shown in figure 25. The water level in well (D-16-3) 32ddc-2 rose sharply in response to the unusually high runoff in 1952 and declined in 1953 and 1954, but the water level at the end of 1954 was still about 7 feet higher than the previous low stage at the end of 1939. This well records the changes of water level in a relatively small, steeply inclined ground-water basin. On the other hand, Beaver County well (C-29-10)6ddc-2 near Milford is in the center of a large group of irrigation wells pumping from an exceptionally large underground reservoir. In general, water-level trends in the Milford district have been downward since 1939 in response to abnormally low precipitation and accelerated pumping, although the quantities of ground water in storage are large, as compared to seasonal changes in storage. The water level in well (C-29-10)6ddc-2 reached the lowest stage in its 22-year record at the end of 1954 when the net lowering in water level during the period from January 1933 to December 1954 amounted to about 6 feet.
The water levels in Iron County wells (C-33-9)34dcd-l in Parowan Valley, (C-35-ll)33aac-l in Cedar City Valley, and (C-35-17)25cdd-l in the Beryl-Enterprise district (fig. 26) have declined significantly during the past several years. During the period from January 1, 1950, through March 30, 1954, the water level in well (C-33-9)34dcd-l declined about 10 feet. At the end of March 1954 the water level was about 1 foot higher than it was on April 18, 1936. The net decline in water level in well (C-35-ll)33aac-l amounted to about 24 feet from January 1933 to December 1954. The net decline in well (C-35-17)25cdd-l amounted to about 12 feet from January 1936 to December 31, 1954. The ground water in the pumping district in Cedar City Valley is considered to be fully appropriated. The Utah State Engineer has not authorized drilling of irrigation wells there since 1942, except as replacements for wells having established rights. In spite of this regulation, water levels in representative wells in 1954 were the lowest of record and 4 to 10 feet lower than the minimums during the drought of the 1930's. This recession is attributed in large part to the current drought in the southwestern United States. In the 5 years ending October 1, 1954, precipitation at Cedar City was markedly less than in any other 5-year period in the past 50 years, and stream runoff was likewise far below average. Water levels in the Beryl-Enter prise district, on the other hand, reflect the gradual unwatering of an exceptionally large underground reservoir. The hydrograph of well (C-35-17)25cdd-l, in the center of this extensive district, shows only minor fluctuations from one year to the next, and indicates a general downward trend that has been in effect since pumping began. This trend has been accelerated during recent years of increased pumping from wells, the net decline from January 1, 1946, to December 31, 1954, amounting to about 11 feet.
Acknowledgments
Water-level records from several observation wells in Salt Lake Valley are furnished through informal cooperation with the Salt Lake City Corporation. Records of 181 observation wells, including 13 recording gages, in the East Shore area of Weber and Davis Counties and 3 recording gages in Wasatch County were furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation.
Well-Numbering System
The well number assigned to each water well in the State indicates the location of the well with reference to land subdivision, according to a system adopted by the State Engineer and described in his 20th Biennial Report (1936), page 87. By this sytem the State is divided into four quadrants by the Salt Lake base and meridian. These quadrants are designated by capital letters, thus: A for the northeast quadrant, representing townships north, ranges east; B for the northwest quadrant, C for the southwest, and D for the southeast. The designation of the township is enclosed in parentheses, which include one of these letters, the number of the township, and the number of the range. Thus, in the number of well (C-28-17)21daa-l in Beaver County, the part within parentheses indicates that the well is in T. 28 S., R. 7 W. The number after the parentheses designates the section, and the lowercase letters give the location of the well within the section, the first letter indicating the quarter section and succeeding letters showing the location within the quarter section down to a 10-acre tract. Thus, number (C-28-7)21daa-l represents well number 1 in the NE^NEiSEi sec. 21, T. 28 S., R. 7 W. In the area surveyed from the Uinta special base and meridian (in Duchesne and Uintah Counties), the well numbers are derived in the same manner and are preceded by the letter U. The State claim or application number given is that used in records of the State Engineer, claim numbers refer to wells that

Scope of Water-Level Program

The observation-well program in Washington was continued in 1954 in cooperation with the State Department of Conservation and Development, Water Resources Division. Included in this report are measurements of 1 lake and 113 wells, 3 of which are included for the first time. Figure 27 shows the location of observation wells in the State. Several wells, not listed in the report, were measured periodically in connection with investigations of the ground-water resources of the Seattle metropolitan area in King County, Tacoma-Central Pierce County area, Lewis County, Whitman County, the Columbia Basin, and other areas.

The following reports on the ground-water resources of Washington were released to the open file in 1954:

Investigation of the rise in level of Soap Lake at Soap Lake, Wash.

Preliminary investigation of ground water in the East Sound area, Orcas Island, San Juan County, Wash.

Geohydrologic evaluation of streamflow records in the Yakima River basin, Washington.

Geology and ground-water resources of Kitsap County, Wash.

Precipitation

The Cascade Range divides the State into eastern and western parts having distinctly different climatic conditions. East of the Cascades precipitation is generally low to moderate. Annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 15 inches, except along the eastern border and in the southeastern corner, where it ranges from 20 to 25 inches and 20 to 40 inches, respectively. In western
Washington, average annual precipitation for most of the central part of the area ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Along the west slope of the Cascades and also along the Pacific Coast, average annual precipitation at many places is as much as 100 inches.

The first of the following tables shows monthly distribution of precipitation at three representative stations. The sprmal precipitation is shown in comparison with the precipitation for 1954. Records of the Olympia station are representative of western Washington; the records of the Ellensburg and the Spokane stations are representative of eastern Washington. The second table shows precipitation for the year ending December 31, 1954, at 10 representative stations; and also the ratio, in percent, of the 1954 precipitation to the normal annual precipitation for each of those stations. Precipitation data were obtained from the U. S. Weather Bureau.

Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
Many aquifers east of the Cascades are never full but maintain a position of equilibrium between recharge and discharge. The water table generally is at a considerable depth, at places being several hundred feet below the land surface. Precipitation available for recharge is rarely rejected; recharge occurs during winter and spring months when precipitation is greatest, and evaporation and transpiration demands are least. For these reasons during a wet cycle, which may continue for a number of years, the water table will show a general rise on which is superimposed the annual fluctuations. During a period of several dry years, of course, the converse is true, and there will be a general decline extending over the period.
Many of the aquifers west of the Cascades are filled to overflowing every year. The water table, which is near the surface, generally reaches a maximum early in the rainy season; continued rainfall holds it at that level. The annual range of fluctuation in these aquifers is much greater than the range caused by cycles of wet and dry years.
Although the preceding paragraphs describe the general ground-water conditions in eastern and western Washington, respectively, it should be pointed out that there are numerous exceptions to the general conditions. Some aquifers in eastern Washington, especially in the large valleys, are shallow and respond rapidly to precipitation.
Water levels in most wells in the western part of the State were generally near normal or above normal during 1954. Water levels in the northeastern part were normal or slightly below early in 1954, or slightly above during the last half of the year. Water levels in central and southeastern Washington were generally below normal because of below-normal precipitation. The greatest deviation was recorded in well 23/19-4E2 at Cashmere in which water levels were below normal, except in January and February, with record lows in April and December. Figure 28 shows hydrographs of three wells with the 1954 month-end water levels compared to the average and range of fluctuation for the period of record.
In general, water levels in those parts of the Columbia Basin project receiving irrigation water, or immediately adjacent to irrigated areas, continued the pronounced rise which started with the application of irrigation water in 1952. However, the rise has generally slowed with each successive irrigation season, and water levels in a few wells have already stabilized within the range of seasonal fluctuation.

Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. For example, in the well number 25/43-15P1, the part before the hyphen indicates township and range (T. 25 N., R. 43 E.) riorth and east of the Willatnette baseline and meridian. Because all townships in Washington are north of the Willamette baseline the letter N, indicating north, is omitted. The letter E is omitted for those ranges east of the Willamette meridian, but W is included when the range lies west of the Willamette meridian. The first digit after the hyphen indicates the section (sec. 15); the letter (P) gives the 40-acre subdivision of the section as shown in the diagram. The last digit (1) Is the serial number of the well in that particular 40-acre tract. Thus, the first well recorded in the SE^SWi sec. 15, T. 25 N., R. 43 E., would have the number 25/43-15P1, and the second would have the number 25/43-15P2.

WYOMING
By D. A. Morris
Scope of Water-Level Program
The observation-well program in Wyoming was continued in 1954 in cooperation with the State Engineer and the city of Cheyenne. Measurements of water levels were made in 107 wells. In addition to the water-level measurements given in this report, many measurements of water levels were made during project studies and have been or will be published in the project reports. Figures 29-33 show the location of observation wells.
Interpretation of Water-Level Fluctuations
Water levels fluctuate in response to precipitation, surface runoff in streams, the amount of water used in irrigated areas, the amount pumped from wells, and the amount of ground water withdrawn by plants. Water levels in surficial deposits of Quaternary age throughout most of the State declined during 1954, the greatest decline being in the Pine Bluffs area, southeastern Laramie County, and in the Wheatland Flats area, central Platte County. Water levels in the alluvium along stream valleys were generally lower than in 1953, the average being 1 foot lower. In irrigated areas along the streams, the use of water for irrigation causes an appreciable fluctuation of water levels. Water levels begin to rise in the spring and continue to rise until irrigation is discontinued in the fall, reaching their peak level about the end of September. In 1954, water levels in the alluvium along the North and South Platte Rivers and their tributaries in southeastern Wyoming were from about 1 to 2. 5 feet lower than in 1953. Water levels in the alluvium of the main stem and tributaries of the Big Horn, Green, and Belle Fourche Rivers declined slightly during the year, generally less than 0. 5 foot. This decline of water levels correlates with the streamflow for the year. Streamflow throughout the State generally was below normal, the greatest deficiency being in the Platte River drainage basin. Locally, along the lower reaches of Muddy Creek, Lodgepole Creek, and Chevington Draw in the vicinity of Pine Bluffs, Laramie County, heavy pumping of ground water for irrigation has caused the water table to lower 10 to 20 feet below the 1940-41 level. Most of this decline occurred during 1954. In surficial deposits of Quaternary age above the valley alluvium and remote from areas of development, water levels generally have declined less than 0. 5 loot during 1954. Water levels in these materials in the upland areas remote from the heavy pumping near Pine Bluffs dropped about 0. 4 foot but were still at a somewhat higher stage than during the early 1940's. Water levels in the terrace deposits of the Wheatland Flats area, Platte County, declined about 6. 5 feet during 1954, reaching a stage 8. 5 feet lower than in 1948 when measurements were first made. This decline is primarily due to lack of recharge caused by deficiency of available surface water for irrigation during 1953 and 1954.
Water levels in deposits of Tertiary age that supply water to most of the stock and domestic wells in the State were about the same as in 1953, except in local areas of heavy pumping. Water levels in the Ogallala formation of Tertiary age in the Cheyenne municipal well field continued to decline in 1954. The average lowering of water levels was about 6 feet, the largest occurring in the part of the well field that was brought into production at the end of 1952. The amount of ground water withdrawn was about 1, 700 million gallons, about 120 million gallons more than in 1953. Water levels in rocks of Tertiary .age in an area south of Cheyenne, outside the city well field, generally have declined more than 100 feet during the past 12 years.
Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management system of land subdivision. The first segment of a well number indicates the township, the second the range, and the third the section. The lowercase letters, a, b, c, and d, after the section number indicate the location of the well within the section; the first letter denotes the 160-acre tract; the second the 40-acre tract; and the third the 10-acre tract. When more than one well is in the smallest significant tract, consecutive numbers beginning with 1 are added as suffixes. The diagram on page 156 is a graphical illustration of this method of well numbering within a section of 640 acres. Well numbers preceded by the capital letters A, B, C, and D designate wells in the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants, respectively, of the Wind River meridian and baseline system. Well numbers not preceded by a capital letter designate wells in the sixth principal meridian and baseline system.
