ABSTRACT Calcium-magnesium carbonate minerals occur as conglomerate cement and travertine within the sedimentary rocks of the upper plate of the Coast Range Thrust. The carbonate deposits of this study are located within Warnick Canyon, Colusa County, California, and occur within the lowest kilometer of the canyon. The mineralogy of the carbonates ranges from aragonite, calcite, Mg-rich calcite, and disordered dolomite. Water temperatures range from 18 to 23°C and pH values from 7.2 to 8.8. Chemically, the waters are mixed Na-Cl and Mg-HCC>3 type-waters.
INTRODUCTION Ubiquitous Ca-Mg carbonate deposits (travertine and conglomerate cements) occur within the lowest kilometer of the Warnick Canyon in the Coast Range, Colusa County, California (Figure 1). The deposits are located in the ephemeral streambed and crop out on the west flank of the canyon. Carbonate specimens were collected from 4 sites (locations) in order to study their mineralogy, chemical composition, and morphology. Water, either from springs in contact with the carbonate deposits or flowing in the streambed, was collected from 4 sites at or near the carbonate deposits. The water was analyzed for major chemical constituents and water isotopic compositions. Few studies of Ca-Mg carbonates from fresh water continental terrains have been reported. The early research by Arnold and Anderson (1908) entailed descriptions, ami interpretations of Ca-Mg carbonates located in the valley of White Creek near Coalinga, California. They reported that the water of White Creek emanated from serpentine terraces as springs with chemical compositions indicative of waters that had reacted with the host rocks at depth. The carbonates formed as a result of evaporation of the stream water as it flowed downstream. Barnes and O'Neil (1971) reported chemical and isotopic compositions of fluids and Ca-Mg carbonates of Holocene cements and travertine from the California Coast Range. The formation of Ca-Mg carbonates in the stream channels of the Coast Range was postulated by Barnes and O'Neil (1971) to result from primary precipitation of solutions formed by the dispersion of Ca-rich solutions into CO3 -rich solutions. Many Ca-Mg carbonate deposits are known to be associated with economically important mineralized and geothermal regimes (for example, Barnes and others, 1973). This preliminary report presents the mineralogical and chemical data of carbonate minerals, together with stable isotopic and chemical data of waters samples collected between 9-91 and 4-92 from Warnick Canyon. This is the first part of a larger study of Mg-Ca carbonate deposits of the Coast Range.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Mr. Harold Pearson for permission to access his property. Without his assistance this study would not have progressed. Mark Huebner, United States Geological Survey (USGS), was instrumental in support during both the field sampling and laboratory analyses, and his talents are greatly appreciated. We also appreciate Terry Keith and Michael Thompson for their critical reviews of the manuscript. We thank Robert Mariner, USGS, for performing the X-ray diffraction analyses.

REGIONAL GEOLOGY The entrance to Warnick Canyon is located at latitude, 39° 01' N and longitude, 122°
23' W and the canyon extends approximately 2 km northward (Figure 1). Located about 40 km southwest of Williams, the canyon lies in the southeast corner of the geologically complex Wilbur Springs structure (Lawton, 1956). The geologic structure of the region is represented by the juxtaposition of the Franciscan complex, the Coast Range Ophiolite, and the Great Valley Sequence (McLaughlin, et al., 1990). The area is crosscut by the Resort fault zone and is bounded by two northwest to northeast trending fault systems: the Bartlette Springs fault zone on the west and by the Bear Valley fault zone on the east (Lawton, 1956 ; McLaughlin, et al, 1990). The mouth of the canyon lies just to the northeast of the Resort fault zone. The canyon formed within the eroded rocks of the Great Valley Sequence (McLaughlin, et al., 1990). The Ca-Mg carbonate deposits of this study occur within the shales, mudstones, and lithic sandstones of the upper plate of the Coast Range thrust which is structurally underlain by detrital serpentinites. The more resistant serpentinites form the ridges of the canyon and their weathering products occur as clasts within the Ca-Mg carbonate conglomerates.
MINERALOGY METHODS: Hand specimens were collected from outcrops and streambed cements along the lower flanks and reaches of Warnick Canyon a tributary to Bear Creek. Five general sites are described that are representative of distinct local geochemical settings. The carbonate specimens were analyzed for mineralogical and chemical composition using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Elemental compositions, morphologies, and relationships of different carbonates within the same sample were documented using scanning electron imaging (SEM). Selected samples were also analyzed using backscattered electron image (BSE). Hand specimens were reduced in size mechanically to pieces no larger than 2 cm and were treated as single grain mounts. Specimens were mounted on aluminum stubs with conductive adhesive for observations and analysis with the SEM and EDX. Each sample was oriented so that the area of interest was clearly visible under a binocular microscope. All samples were coated with carbon for SEM analyses. If adequate photomicrographs could not be obtained because of sample charging, then a coating of gold/palladium was applied.
SITE LOCATIONS AND DATA: Data applicable to the mineralogy of the carbonates in this study are presented under the sites where the samples were collected. Water samples from springs and flowing stream water were gathered at the time of mineral specimen collection whenever available or at nearby sites. The water data are presented in Table 1.

Site A The carbonate deposit at site A (Figure 1) crops out on the west flank of Warnick Canyon about 20 m above the stream channel in partially exposed terraces (4) containing travertines and conglomerate cements (Figure 2). Thicknesses of the terraces are approximately one meter and individually they extend laterally no more than 5 m. The entire sequence extends about 15m and slopes at about 35° towards the streambed, indicating a slump feature. No fluids were present at this outcrop during the collection period of this study. Figures 3 shows the texture and typical lithic fragments within the carbonate cement of the deposit. Figure 3b is a SEM BSE micrograph of cement and serpentinite clasts within the cement from site A. The variable MgCC>3 composition of the carbonates from site A are shown on the diffractograms together with the relative amounts of aragonite and other minor minerals (Figure 4a and 4b). The elemental compositions of the Ca-Mg carbonates of site A are shown on Figure 5a and 5b.
SiteB Site B is located on the west side of the stream bed and is situated below and 10 m downstream of site A (Figure 1). During the collection period of our study, groundwater at this site flowed from a spring beneath the exposed carbonate lenses that were lithologically similar to the travertines and conglomerates at site A. These lenses are roughly horizontal and are about 15m long and 1 m thick (Figure 6). At the base of the outcrop, halite occurs and the Ca-Mg carbonate beds are in direct contact with the site B spring (Figure 7). The diffractogram for the Ca-Mg carbonates at site B shows that Mg compositions are similar to those at site A and appear to be near dolomite in MgCC>3 composition (Figure 8). At site B, silver and nickel were observed as descrete phases in the carbonate cement together with Cl and Si (Figure 9). Even though nickel and chromium occur in the lithic serpentinite fragments in the carbonate cements (Figure lOa and lOb), the silver and nickel were determined by EDX to be chloride salts in the Ca-Mg carbonate cements (Figure 9). Elemental titanium was also identified by EDX in the Ca-Mg carbonate cement from site B. No investigative study was done to quantify any of these metals.
SiteC No carbonate specimens were found at this location. Water samples collected at this site emanates from fractured bedrock in the stream bed.
SiteD Site D is located approximately 40 m downstream from site A (Figure 1). The site is approximately 20 m above the stream bed on the west flank of the canyon (Figure 1). The exposed conglomerate is lithologically similar to the conglomerate at site A (Figure 11). The outcrop is <1 m thick and approximately 2 m in length. The outcrop is part of the general slump feature of the hillside. During the collection period of this study no fluids were observed at site D. The MgCC>3 composition of the carbonate cement at site D is indicated by the diffractogram as shown on Figure 12. The elemental composition of the carbonate at site D, shown on Figure 13, supports the presence of the MgCC>3 component shown on the corresponding diffractogram (Figure 12).

SiteE No carbonate specimens were found at this location. Water samples collected at this site emanates from fractured bedrock in the stream bed.
SiteF Site F is located at the mouth of Warnick Canyon. Samples were collected from the apron that is forming on the north bank of Bear Creek (Figure 1). The apron is approximately 3m thick, 10m wide, and 5 m in length (Figure 14). The carbonate mineralogy at site F varies from aragonite to disordered dolomite. Figures 15a and 15b show diffractograms of the carbonates at site F. Typically, aragonite thinly coats the top surface of the apron (Figure 16) and also coats the galleries formed within eroded portions of the apron (Figure 17). The SEM micrographs of aragonite and the Ca-Mg carbonates of site F are shown on Figures 18 and 19, respectively. Lastly, Ni and Cl occur in the elemental composition of the carbonate cement determined by EDX as shown on Figure 20.
WATER CHEMISTRY Methods: The methods utilized for field determination of pH and laboratory sample preparation are described in Presser and Barnes (1985). Alkalinity concentrations were determined by titration with acid on an automatic titrator. The alkalinity was determined on samples collected in bottles completely filled, sealed with polyseal caps, and stored under refrigeration. Chloride concentrations were estimated using a silver dichromate indicator strip (±4%). Sulfate concentrations were estimated using turbidimetric readings of precipitated barium sulfate solutions. Cations, silica, and boron were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (±2%).

ISOTOPES Methods: Stable isotope analyses were performed on water samples collected at the field sites in 15 mL glass bottles with polyseal caps. The oxygen isotopic compositions of waters were determined by analyzing CO2 which had been equilibrated with these solutions at 25°C (Epstein and Mayeda, 1953). The hydrogen isotopic compositions were determined on H2
produced during reduction of water over Zn at 450 C in 6 mm glass tubes with a precision of ±1 permil (W.W. Carothers and R.H. Brigham, unpublished method). Dissolved CO2 species were precipitated in the field by adding 20 mL saturated ammoniacal SrCl2 to approximately 100 mL of water. Prior to isotopic analysis for 813C values, the SrCO3 precipitates were filtered and washed under an a CO2 free atmosphere, dried, and homogenized in a ball mill. The precipitates were reacted with >100% H3PO4 at 25°C and the evolved CO2 collected for isotopic analysis (McCrea, 1950). All isotopic measurements for oxygen and hydrogen are reported in Table 2 in permil deviations relative to SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water). The 813C values are reported relative to PDB (Chicago Peedee belemnite standard). The precision of a single measurement is ±0.1 permil for oxygen and carbon values.
