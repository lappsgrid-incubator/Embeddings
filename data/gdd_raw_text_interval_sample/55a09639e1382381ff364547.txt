UNITED STATES EARTHQUAKES, 1961

INTRODUCTION

This publication is a summary of earthquake activity in the United States and regions under its jurisdiction for the calendar year 1961. The sources of noninstrumental information used in the compilation include the United States Weather Bureau, whose observers prepare periodic reports on local seismic activity; telegraphic information collected by Science Service, Washington, D.C.; Bulletins of the Seismological Society of America; special reports of the Jesuit Seismological Association and the Northeastern Seismological Association; the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Summary: newspaper clippings; and reports from interested individuals. Instrumental data used in locating earthquakes are obtained from the network of Coast and Geodetic Survey stations listed on page 46 and from other cooperating Seismological stations in the United States and throughout the world.
The Coast and Geodetic Survey endeavors to coordinate efforts in collecting all types of earthquake information with the special object of correlating instrumental earthquake locations with noninstrumental reports received from the epicentral areas. This is done by local organizations making intensive regional investigations in California and elsewhere, and, when necessary, by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This information serves to map the seismic areas of the country adequately and promote public safety through a better understanding of earthquake phenomena. Since the success of the general information service depends largely on the cooperation of local officials and citizens, all are urged

to fill out and return earthquake questionnaires.
Earthquake information services. The Coast and Geodetic Survey maintains a Seismological Field Survey in San Francisco to collect earthquake information and make field investigations of strong shocks in the Pacific coast and western mountain States. Details concerning damage, destruction, and other effects are enumerated in the quarterly Abstracts of Earthquake Reports for the Pacific Coast and the Western Mountain Region. This report is available on request from the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C., 20230. Active cooperation in this work is received from the University of California Seismographic Station, Berkeley (Dr. Perry Byerly, in charge); and the Seismological Laboratory, Pasadena (Dr. Frank Press, Director); as well as State Collaborators in Seismology. The following Collaborators served as agents of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in their respective States in 1961:
Arizona. Dr. Eldred D. Wilson, University of Arizona, Tucson.
Colorado. Prof. W. Warren Longley, University of Colorado, Boulder.
Idaho. Dr. Earl F. Cook, Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, Moscow.
Montana. Prof. Stephen W. Nile,
Montana School of Mines, Butte. Nevada. Dr. David B. Slemmons, Uni-
versity of Nevada, Reno. New Mexico. Prof. Stuart A. North-
rop, University of New Mexico, Albu-
querque. 1

Oregon. Dr. Ira S. Allison, Oregon State College, Corvallis.
Utah. Prof. J. Stewart Williams, Utah State University, Logan.
Washington. Prof. Howard A. Coombs, University of Washington, Seattle.
Wyoming. Prof. Horace D. Thomas, University of Wyoming, Laramie.
Among the commercial agencies on the West Coast rendering valuable services are telephone, power, oil, railroad, and especially insurance companies. Certain concerns interested in the manufacture of earthquake-resistant building materials are also active, together with various organizations of structural engineers and architects.
In other parts of the country the Jesuit
Seismological Association with central office at St. Louis University collects in-
formation in the central Mississippi Valley
area (Rev. Dr. Victor J. Blum, S.J., Dean
of the Institute of Technology). The

Northeastern Seismological Association with headquarters at Weston College, Weston, Mass. (Rev. Daniel J. Linehan, S.J., in charge), undertakes similar work in the northeastern States. Additional information is furnished regularly by Mr. Berlen C. Moneymaker, Chief Geologist, Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, Tenn., for earthquakes in the State of Tennessee, and Dr. Gerald R. MacCarthy, Department of Geology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C., for earthquakes in the State of North Carolina.
Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931. All intensities used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey refer to the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931. 1 The abridged version of this scale is given here with equivalent intensities according to the Rossi-Forel scale.

MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY SCALE OF 1931

(ABRIDGED)
I. Not felt except by a very few under specially favorable circumstances. (I Rossi-Forel scale.)
II. Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings. Delicately suspended objects may swing. (I to II Rossi-Forel scale.)
III. Felt quite noticeably indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings, but many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motorcars may rock slightly. Vibration like passing of truck. Duration estimated. (Ill Rossi-Forel scale.)
IV. During the day felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night some awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls make creaking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing motorcars rocked noticeably. (IV to V Rossi-Forel scale.)
V. Felt by nearly everyone, many awakened. Some dishes, windows, etc., broken; a few instances of cracked plaster; unstable objects overturned. Disturbances of trees, poles, and other tall objects sometimes noticed. Pendulum clocks may stop. (V to VI Rossi-Forel scale.)
VI. Felt by all, many frightened and run outdoors. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster or damaged chimneys. Damage slight. (VI to VII Rossi-Forel scale.)
VII. Everybody runs outdoors. Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in wellbuilt ordinary structures; considerable in poorly built or badly designed struc-

tures; some chimneys broken. Noticed by persons driving motorcars. (VIII Rossi-Forel scale.) Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse; great in poorly built structures. Panel walls thrown out of frame structures. Fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned. Sand and mud ejected in small amounts. Changes in well water. Persons driving motorcars disturbed. (VIII+ to IX RossiForel scale.) Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures thrown out of plumb; great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations. Ground cracked conspicuously. Underground pipes broken. (IX+ Rossi-Forel scale.) Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with foundations; ground badly cracked. Rails bent. Landslides considerable from riverbanks and steep slopes. Shifted sand and mud. Water splashed (slopped) over banks. (X Rossi-Forel scale.) Few, if any, (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges destroyed. Broad fissures in ground.

Epicenter maps. Figure 1 is designed to show the existence of destructive and near destructive earthquakes in the United States through 1961. The smallest dots indicate the shock was strong enough to overthrow chimneys or affect an area of more than 25,000 square miles (intensity VII to VIII); the largest solid dots may be associated with damage ranging from several thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars, or to shocks usually perceptible over more than 150,000 square miles (intensity VIII to IX); the smaller encircled dots represent damage ranging from approximately one hundred thousand to one million dollars, or an affected area greater than 500,000 square miles (intensity IX to X); the larger encircled dots represent damage of a million dollars or more, or an affected area usually greater than 1,000,000 square miles (intensity X to XII).
Figure 2 shows earthquake distribution in the United States during 1961. In a few cases where instrumental control is not satisfactory or where results of investigations are inadequate, the plotted epicenters should be considered as showing the existence of the earthquake rather than the precise location.
In figure 2, those earthquakes occurring in the California area are plotted when felt reports are received from several places. Earthquakes reported as feeble are not plotted on the epicenter map of the United States, nor are minor aftershocks plotted for heavy earthquakes in

California or any other region. The number after a dot indicates the number of shocks which have occurred at or near the location shown. Bulletins of the University of California Seismographic Station, Berkeley and the Seismological Laboratory, Pasadena, should be consulted for further details regarding epicenters and often for data on additional shocks.
The selection of isoseismal or "felt area" maps (figs. 3-6) is governed largely by the size of the area affected, the minimum radius generally being of the order of 50 miles. In the case of sharp localized shocks this means that some earthquakes of intensity VI (mostly in California) will not be shown on such maps whereas others of intensity IV and V (largely in the eastern and central areas) will be shown.
Teleseismic results. On page 46 is a list of Survey and cooperating teleseismic stations for which the Survey publishes results. During the year the locations of 2415 epicenters were announced promptly on Preliminary Determination of Epicenter cards. Those desiring to receive these cards should request addition of their name to the PDE mailing list. All seismogram interpretations are published in the monthly Seismological Bulletin, MSI series, available on mailing list CGS-7 from the Director, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C., 20230. During the year 1961, MSI-241 through 252 for the monthly bulletins of 1961 were published.

Magnitude and Intensity (Damage] Ratings. Magnitude Rating, stated according to The Gutenberg-Richter scale, is a measure of the energy-release at the focus of the earthquake, having therefore a fundamental relation to the shock. It is estimated by the analysis of seismograph records, as explained in the Bulletin of Seismological Society oj America,, Vol. 32, No. 3, 1942. Intensity (Damage) Rating, usually expressed on the Modified Mercalli Scale oj 1931, is a local measure of the effects on people and objects at any affected locality, being, therefore a result of many factors, including energyrelease of the earthquake, distance, geological and topographic conditions, and structural properties of buildings. It varies from place to place. The two ratings are not simply comparable.
Strong-motion seismograph results. The maintenance of a network of strongmotion seismographs and analysis of the records of destructive earthquake motions thus obtained are functions of the Bureau in connection with a broad cooperative program of research being carried out on the Pacific Coast with a number of local organizations and institutions interested in the engineering aspects of the earthquake problem. The details of this program are described in S.P. 201, Earthquake Investigations in California, 1934-35.
The preliminary analyses of strongmotion records are published in the Quarterly Engineering Seismology Bulletin

which is available upon request from the Director, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C., 20230. The revised analyses are given in table 7.
Earthquake history. A history of the more important shocks of the country appears in Publication 41-1, Earthquake History oj the United States. Part I covers continental United States and Alaska, exclusive of California and western Nevada; Part II covers the stronger earthquakes of California and western Nevada. The first part was revised in 1958 and the latter in 1961.
A history of minor activity is covered largely in a series of references listed in Publication 41-1, in recent reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and in the Bulletin oj the Seismological Society oj America, Volume 29, No. 1, January 1939. The last two references give detailed information for all California earthquakes. The last one contains all information appearing in early catalogs published by the Smithsonian Institution.
A summary of the earthquake program as carried out in the United States is briefly outlined in S.P. 282, Earthquake Investigation in the United States, revised 1962. The major organizations and stations are listed together with a list of the independent and/or privately operated stations. This publication is available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 20402, for 25 cents.

reported minor damage such as cracked plaster, glassware, fallen lamps, etc. Stores suffered considerable loss from fallen merchandise. Many homes in Union, Cienega, and Southside districts reported broken chimneys and cracked walls. Some ranches reported damaged water lines and pumps. Powerlines shorted in some sections; swinging lines crossed and burned out at one place in Hollister.
W. A. Taylor Winery (about 7 miles south of Hollister at Vineyard). This location is the subject of a detailed report entitled "Creep on the San Andreas Fault," published in the BSSA, July I960, issue. Studies indicate the San Andreas fault has been "creeping" at the rate of about one-half inch a year since 1948, and strong evidence suggests that it has been creeping for at least 50 years. It was reported a total of 0.4 inch "instantaneous creep" occurred during the April 8 earthquakes. Winery buildings are primarily wood frame; lower part of wall is concrete. Building damage was confined to tearing caused by the fault movement, plus the collapse of one small brick interior wall. A number of large wood stave wine tanks, resting directly on unanchored wood joists on concrete piers, were shifted off supports. The bottom of one 7,941-gallon tank was ruptured and all contents lost; another leaked badly and lost about 1,050 gallons. Small pipeline broken (broken many times in the past by the fault creep). Nearby road cracking could not be associated with the fault creep within the building. Brick house chimney fell. A 50-foot fissure about 2-3 inches wide was observed on Cienega Road about 3 miles from the winery. At the Harris Ranch on Cienega Road, pantry shelves torn from walls; chimney cracked; oneinch water pipe broken; ground cracked and landslides; concrete-lined reservoir cracked and water level lowered 5 inches; 12-inch Oak tree toppled. Motion reported as severe in both north-south and east-west directions but more severe in the north-south direction, as observed by the relative displacement of objects. Other locations on Cienega Road reported chimneys damaged, one fell; 3-inch pipeline broken; refrigerator toppled; piano moved 8 inches.

MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES

GEODETIC WORK OF SEISMOLOGICAL INTEREST
The program of repeating geodetic control surveys for the purpose of detecting horizontal and vertical movement in the earth's crust was continued in 1961.
A resurvey was made early in 1962 over the closely spaced monuments near the Taylor Winery at Hollister, Calif. The results of this survey do not indicate any appreciable change from the observations made the previous year.
A survey was made in the Monterey Bay area which extends to the northeast through Salinas and Hollister. The previous earthquake survey in this area was made in 1951. Observations in the recent survey indicate that some movement has occurred in the vicinities of Salinas and Hollister.
A releveling was undertaken in 1961
along certain lines in the Arvin-Maricopa
area of California and along "earthquake
cross lines" at Gorman, Palmdale, and
Cajon Pass, Calif. At each of the "cross lines" about 200 bench marks were
established in 1935 normal to the San Andreas fault. These lines have now been
leveled from four to six times.

At Cajon Pass the vertical change from 1935 to 1961 has been about 31 millimeters, at Palmdale about 186 millimeters, and at Gorman about 122 millimeters.
TIDAL DISTURBANCES OF SEISMIC ORIGIN
Three minor tsunamis were reported during the year, none of which were recorded on tide gages for which the Coast and Geodetic Survey serves as record repository.
A tsunami off the coast of southern Japan on February 26, 1961 (31.6° north, 131.2° east), generated a wave that was recorded locally. A 38 inch fall-to-rise tsunami was observed in southwest Shikoku.
An earthquake in the New Hebrides Islands on July 23, 1961 (18.5° north, 168.3° east) generated a tsunami with a range of 4.9 feet at Port Vila and Forari. Slight damage was caused at both locations.
An earthquake off the east coast of Hokkaido, Japan (43.0° north, 145.0° east), on August 11, 1961, generated a minor tsunami. The maximum range as recorded at Nemuro was 6 inches.

FLUCTUATIONS IN WELL WATER LEVELS

INTRODUCTION

The following data are tabulated for the purpose of associating fluctuations in well water levels with earthquakes. The data are made available by the Ground Water Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. Complete information on earthquakes may be obtained from the Preliminary Determination of Epicenter cards issued by the Coast and Geodetic Survey or from registers of seismographic stations nearest the locality.
Similar data for 1943 were published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in United States Earthquakes, 1943, and those for 1944 through 1949 appeared in United States Earthquakes, 1949. Data for the years subsequent to 1950 were published annually in United States Earthquakes, 1950 through 1960.

46 COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

SEISMOLOGICAL OBSERVATORY RESULTS

The Coast and Geodetic Survey pub-
lishes the results of its teleseismic stations
and cooperating stations in the monthly
Seismological Bulletin. All seismogram interpretations are tabulated together with epicenters based on the published
data and instrumental results received from seismological stations in all parts of
the world. Instrumental results are
published for the following stations:
Albuquerque, N. Mex. Balboa Heights
(The Panama Canal Co.) Boulder City, Nev.
(Bureau of Reclamation) Bozeman, Mont.
(Montana State College) Butte, Mont.
(Montana School of Mines) Byrd, Antarctica Chicago, 111.
(University of Chicago and U.S. Weather Bureau)
College, Alaska College-Outpost, Alaska Columbia, S.C.
(University of South Carolina) Eureka, Nev.
(Eureka Power & Light Co.) Flaming Gorge, Utah
(Bureau of Reclamation) Glen Canyon, Ariz.
(Bureau of Reclamation) Guam, Mariana Islands Honolulu, Hawaii Hungry Horse, Mont.
(Bureau of Reclamation) Kipapa, Hawaii Lincoln, Nebr.
(Nebraska Wesleyan University) Philadelphia, Pa.
(The Franklin Institute)

Rapid City, S. Dak. (South Dakota State School of Mines and Technology)
Salt Lake City, Utah (University of Utah)
San Juan, Puerto Rico Sitka, Alaska South Pole, Antarctica Thule, Greenland
(U.S. Army Ionosphere Station) Tucson, Ariz. Tucson, Telemeter, Ariz. Ukiah, Calif.
(International Latitude Observatory) Washington, D.C.
Albuquerque, Byrd, College, CollegeOutpost, Guam, Honolulu, Kipapa, San Juan, Sitka, South Pole, Tucson, TucsonTelemeter, Ukiah, and Washington are Coast and Geodetic Survey stations.
Balboa Heights, Boulder City, Bozeman, Butte, Chicago, Columbia, Eureka, Flaming Gorge, Glen Canyon, Hungry Horse, Lincoln, Philadelphia, Rapid City, Salt Lake City, and Thule are cooperating stations.
Albuquerque began operation in October 1961, and Lincoln was discontinued in June 1961.

TABLE 2. Summary of instrumental epicenters for 1961
NOTE. The origin time, coordinates of provisional epicenter and focal depth (h) are computed using an electronic computer. The origin time is computed such that the average residual (average difference between computed and observed arrival time at stations) is not greater than 2.0 seconds. All magnitudes are determined by Pasadena, except where quoted by Palisades (Pal) and Berkeley (Brk).

STRONG-MOTION SEISMOGRAPH RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
During 1932, the Coast and Geodetic Survey inaugurated a program of recording strong ground movements in the seismically active regions of the country to obtain basic data needed in the design of earthquake-resistant structures. Notes pertinent to this program will be found in the preceding issues of the United States Earthquake series and in S.P. 201 Earthquake Investigations in California, 1934~35. The latter is much broader in scope than the former, and contains data on structural and ground vibrations with detailed descriptions of the various activities which comprise the seismological program as a whole.
Interpretation of records. The analyses appearing in tables 6 and 7 are based on the assumption of simple harmonic motion. This refers especially to the computation of displacement from accelerograph records. As most accelerograph records are of irregular character, and the character of the longer period waves is often obscured by the superposition of shorter period waves of relatively large amplitude, the estimates of displacement must be considered only rough approximations. These analyses are essentially condensations of material appearing in the Quarterly Engineering Seismology Bulletin available through mailing list CGS-5 from the Director, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C., 20230.
Units and instrumental constants. Quantitative results are expressed in c.g.s. units; centimeters or millimeters for displacement; and centimeters per second per second for acceleration. It is sometimes desirable to express acceleration in terms of the acceleration of gravity, indicated by "g" which is equal to 980 cm/ sec. 2 For practical purposes it is only necessary to point off three decimal places to convert cm/sec. 2 to "g".

Most of the instruments have been adjusted so that each will register the maximum acceleration to be expected on the particular type of geological formation beneath the instrument. The following expectable earthquake accelerations were used in determining the accelerograph sensitivities: (a) rock foundation, 25 percent of gravity; (b) residual clay and shale, 40 percent of gravity; (c) alluvium, 70 percent of gravity; and (d) top floors of tall buildings, 100 to 200 percent of gravity. The four sensitivities may be roughly listed as 26, 19.5, 13, and 6.5 mm. per 0.1 g., respectively.
Sensitivity of the seismographs is expressed as the deflection of the trace, or light spot, in centimeters, for a constant acceleration of 0.1 g.
Damping ratio of the pendulum is the ratio between successive amplitudes when the pendulum oscillates.
Seismogram illustrations. Reproductions of records in this publication are tracings of the original records and must not be accepted as genuine copies. The tabulated instrumental constants refer to the original records. The tracings are intended to show the nature of the data rather than furnish a means through which the reader can make his own measurements. Those who desire true copies for critical study should make request to the Director, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.C., 20230.
Acceleration and displacement scales representing the equivalent of 0.1 g. and 1 inch are indicated on the tracings of the acceleration and displacement curves. The scales provide the investigator with a quick means for making rough measurements on the published curves. The measurements of period on records of this nature are dependent largely on the judg-
ment of the person reading them and
considerable latitude must be allowed in

98 COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

appraising their accuracy. The aim of such analyses is primarily to give a fair picture of the magnitudes of the various elements involved, and the figures tabu-

lated should therefore not be used for important studies without first referring to the illustrations for some idea of the nature of the original records.
